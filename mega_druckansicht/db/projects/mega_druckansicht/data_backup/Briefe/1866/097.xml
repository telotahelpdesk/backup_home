                                        stuff.—Tossed about, for half a lifetime, as he has been,
                                        from wave to shore, from shore to wave—but wretched little
                                        amusement and far to much hard work—to this, to have been
                                        badly afflicted for something like a tenth part of a
                                        century, by continued sickness, and yet to hold his head up
                                        and walk again, like a man … this seems more than one
                                        can do, without the aid of magic powers. But there are
                                        occasions, at which men seem much alike—if looked at from a
                                        goodly distance. For example we all are always ready to

                                        improbable it may seem, if it only chances to fit our
                                        likeings. I tell you, it fits mine—and I should like to see
                                        you well. I was exceedingly pleased to hear you are out of
                                        all danger now and even better, as you ever was before. So

                                <p sameAs="MBTextmitEinzug">If you but could do as you liked, it
                                        would be infinitly better for you to live altogether
                                        somewhere on the sea side, or in some other merry place,
                                        than in that nasty London. It will never do for any one that
                                        once had serious wreck of health. Besides this, there is, in
                                        such an accumulation, to much cause for you, to meet with
                                        anger and annoyance … Come on, I shall talk to you now, like
                                        an old man. But don't laugh.—In my high opinion, there is,
                                        in every man's life, a decided period, when he rejoices to
                                        study and to learn, whatever it will cost him; learn more
                                        and more, and all he meets, he takes to heart, as so much of
                                        a useful lesson.</p>
                                <p sameAs="MBTextmitEinzug">There comes then, inevitably too—another
                                        period, when he gets sick of any further learning and often
                                        even, should like to know of many things, far less. He now
                                        rejoices in forgetting. Theese two periods are however
                                        seldom sharply trenched, but to the contrary, so closely
                                        often interweaven, at the ends and beginning of each of
                                        them, that most poeples are not aware of an existing change,
                                        even if it existes for years and years. Some catastrophe
                                        than, in their life, that does come on like a thunderstorm
                                        in spring, does set them suddenly on the alarm—they percieve
                                        the accomplished change, they think the effect to be the
                                        cause, belive the world to have grown worse, of what it ever
                                        was before—grow dull and never smile, as on the eve, the day
                                        of which they lay their heads on chaps … I do belive, that
                                        my good Mohr is one of those, who, by the life they had to
                                        lead, must long have reached the highest pitch in studying
                                        mankind. His philosophy must be formed. He needs no more to
                                        know, and would do well, if he could but forget. He must
                                        have passed his learning phase, when he thought, that every
                                        new deception he was subjected to, that every <expan resp="editor" sameAs="dottet_underline">fals<ex>e</ex></expan> friend he brake with, was
                                        worthy lesson for a future time, and he would profit of.
                                        No—them self same lessons, in the present day, will make one
                                        heartsick and spoil the blood. And crowded London is sure
                                        not a place, where one could soon forget, what he has seen
                                        there most. One wants a merry land for this, a deep blue
                                        sea—a lovely shore, the jolly boulevards, et du petit bleu.
                                        But all this wanting, you have dull hours, the physik-battle
                                        takes the place of books and the pipe, you do not enjoy your
                                        life by half, and almost wish that you should be no more. I
                                        have felt all this as well, and therefore feel with each
                                        one, that does feel like I.</p>

                                        and were so bold, because they said: they know they were in

                                <p sameAs="MBTextmitEinzug"><pb/> They wagg'd their tale as long as
                                        they smelled crap, that seemed quite close at hand. I for my
                                        part, I dare not exactly blame any one, that does things out
                                        of interest. But one thing I hate—and this is, if poeple do
                                        it in to showy and to unclean a manner. Do nothing without
                                        an interest, but at least hide it, and do it in a decent
                                        manner. To look for interest, I think, is so general and
                                        natural a disposition, that you will find it to be the
                                        motive power for all and every one, from the meanest animal,
                                        through mankind, the saints all and the angels, together
                                        with our good old man in heaven. As to him, we are told, he
                                        lived a huge tremendous part of his eternity, in stern
                                        lazyness and annoyance, until at last he grew so dammnedably
                                        sick and tired of it, nothing but gaping and scratching his
                                        head, that he made up his mind to put a step to it—and made
                                        the world. His interest then was, to get some sport—need man
                                        to be ashamed? In fact; motive, reason, interest, are all
                                        but different words for the very selfsame thing. A man gives
                                        a poor beggar a “bob” he sais; he followd the generous
                                        motive of doing good to others. This sounds well! At the
                                        same time if he questiones himself closely, he will find,
                                        that he had the interest before all, to quench his interieur
                                        uneasiness, which he was sure, as he has found on former
                                        occasion, he would have felt and be troubled with, that
                                        would have cost him an hour and half's of sleep, or more,
                                        had he not given the shilling away——uneasiness resulted by
                                        means of a particular sentimental education, some others are
                                        fully free of. All may be reduced to interestedness, and I
                                        consider it mere proudness of one, to belive himself exempte
                                        of it. But I admit of a difference in the sort of
                                        interestedness. I find that the meanness of a man's
                                        interest, increases in direct ratio to the closeness it is
                                        stationed, to the hand of those that want to attain it. For
                                        example:——The prussian Hussars—those who give no pardon, but
                                        are always glad to take it— stand in the roaring battle. A
                                        lieutenant is taken prisoner, because his hors has kicked
                                        him off. The commanding general calls for volunteers to free
                                        him, of two drummers that hold him. As none comes out of the
                                        file he offers 15 jute Jroschen to bring him hither. A
                                        patriotic “Hinterpommer” spurs his fiery steed and fetches
                                        the swooming lieutenant back, tied to his horses tale … etc.
                                        The fellow may have had different interests for doing this
                                        heroic action. The nearest interest was the fifteen “jute
                                                Jros<ex>c</ex>hen”—the second: the leaden decoration
                                        his is sure to get, the third: the applause of the multitude
                                        together with the gentle stroke on his cheek by the
                                        astonished general, the fourth: that he will go to heaven
                                        for it and the fifth: that, should he ever get himself in
                                        trouble, by stealing a cotton pocket handkerchief of his
                                        corporal, he would have the probability, instead of being
                                        otherwise shot, to be pardoned to 150 lashes only. You
                                        clearly see: the first interest— about the money—was the
                                        vilest; the following grew nobler and nobler … <persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000001027">Creamer</persName> and

                                        the multitude to which he belonged, and personal prospects.

                                        class. They were as good Englishmen as any
                                        bourg<ex>e</ex>ois, and thought little about continental
                                        affairs, which only may bear a very remote interest indeed.
                                        Up to now, I found the great heap of working men as
                                        creatures, that can no further be trusted, as the profit is
                                        within the reach of their mouth, and even then you want a
                                        deal of persuasion to make them bite. They fell off.—They
                                        will come to again, and—belive me—the same may fell off
                                        again. Never trust them far! I hate faithlessness more than
                                        death. In matters of importance one should never give his
                                        word, unless he feels himself man to fall with it. There are
                                        occasions in life, when we may—in the worst of cases—fail …
                                        where unlooked for circumstances laid rocks in our ways …
                                        There are others—we <hi rendition="#u">dare</hi> not fail,
                                        whatever unlooked for events will thunder down our might.
                                        Where I feel myself to weak—I never promise.</p>

                                        when I first left my fathers house, where I had passed a
                                        very dull youth, as dull as any boy may have passed one—it
                                        was perhaps the most happy hour of my life, when I saw the
                                        town vanish at a distance. I tell you: I was never so
                                        fortunate to know, what love to on's parents is. I hated my

                                        and the world became my home. But a few miles distance, a
                                        few years time, soon mended all, and as misfortune had long
                                        created the simularity of mind in me and them—soon space
                                        between us, brought us closer to each oneother. We grew
                                        friends, and were no less sorry, for what has passed in
                                        younger days, when we had to part for ever. I remember I
                                        wept.</p>
