                            This, we suppose, was <hi rendition="#u">money advanced to purchase the

                            interest of nearly every director in the Co. was made to appear as fully
                            paid up. In 18 months, which was the utmost extent of its career, the
                            Co. did much mischief. First, it became the focus of 5 several
                            amalgamations m<ex>it</ex> other Cos; and thus acquired nearly 400
                            shareholders, now liable as contributories, but prepared to contest it.
                            None of the directors in any of these amalgamating concerns took any
                            share or interest in the Co. to which they thus handed over their own
                            shareholders. And these projects, we may presume, had been got up upon
                            the same liberal and philanthropical principles, and pure u<ex>nd</ex>
                            disinterested motives, as the Co. in question. In one instance there
                            were special provisions for annuities in favour of such of the directors
                            as were not to receive any of the emoluments to be distributed amongst
                            the members of the new board, and of their widows after them! They were
                            evidently prudent, farseeing man, these directors of the amalgamating

                                d<ex>en</ex> terms of their policies, also workingmen in victims.

                            agents repudiate their liability. Court has, therefore, resorted to the
                            extraordinary expedient of appointing a special commission to take

                            official one who makes these preliminary revelations. Up to the time at
                            which he wrote, the official liquidator had received upwards of 1000
                            claims upon the Co. Amongst these claims one for £1,600 on the<hi rendition="#u"> part of the manager</hi> and previous liquidator,
                            u<ex>nd</ex>, of this claim, £600 made upon an unpaid cheque on account of salary.
                            Drawn when there were cheques already issued to £1,300 more than the
                            balance at the Co’s bankers. The remainder was for an alleged deposit by
                            the manager, who, through his assignee, claimed £2,600 for unpaid
                            salary. This gent, not content with the £10,000 he obtained for getting
                            up the Co., wants £2,600 for bringing it to ruin in the Winding-up
                            Court. The Co which this manager mismanaged never issued but one
                            balance-sheet, and that was entirely false and fraudulent. Two balance
                            sheets were prepared, „both of the same date, but materially differing
                            in nearly every line; one corresponding with the books, the other
                            corresponding with them in scarcely <pb n="22"/> very single item“;<seg type="comment"><orig> the one was suppressed, the false one issued.
                                    During the 18 months’ existence of the Co. this manager managed
                                    to bring into use some 850 books, exclusive of those at the 700
                                    agencies, and exclusive of those handed over by the amalgamated
                                    Cos, making probably more than 2000 books; and, although some 30
                                    clerks were employed by the Co., their salaries were all in
                                    arrear, and there was a gap in the account books for 4 months

                            Falsch that the losses sustained by certain members of the community
                            have been the gains of other members, and, that, therefore, the public
                            in its totality has sustained no loss. But the difference between the
                            gains of one class and the losses of the other has been enormous.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Those losses have been the natural result of excesses
                            which prevailed during the 2 or 3 years of enterprise and speculation
                            which immediately preceded the panic of 1866. During that period an
                            immense amount of <hi rendition="#u">property so called</hi> – i. e.
                            property which was nominally and apparently real, but in fact fictitious
                            – was created, and bought and sold according to its nominal value. A
                            joint-stock Co. put forth its prospectus, proposing to raise a nominal
                            capital of 1 Mill. St., on which one 10<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, or
                            £100,000 was to be paid. The one million being subscribed, and the
                            £100,000 paid, the shares rose to a premium, and the value of the
                            £100,000 became £500,000, and at that value £500,000 of hard cash, let
                            us say, was invested in them. The purchasers or owners believed that
                            they were in actual possession of <hi rendition="#u">bona fide</hi>
                            property to that amount, and, on the faith of that assurance, they
                            bought and sold other property, and entered into other contracts and
                            engagements, and launched out, and lived, and consumed, and expended
                            accordingly. But when the panic came the £400,000 which had been created
                            in the shape of <hi rendition="#u">premium</hi> gradually melted away.
                            As the depression resulting from the panic continued, the £100,000, the
                            amount originally paid also disappeared. The whole became worth nothing
                            at all. After a time this not the whole loss. The Co. being in the
                            winding up court, there were numerous debts to be paid, and the calls of
                            the liquidators to meet. There are eating into and consuming whatever
                            property the hapless holders of the shares had reserved to themselves.
                            They have been compelled to abandon or withdraw from the contracts they
                            had entered into on the faith of this property, so called, and to
                            curtail their expenditure, and to lessen their business transactions, if
                            not utterly to abandon them, in order that they may have the means to
                            meet the calls. This occurred not in one but in 100 Cos. The number of
                            traders, investors, and other individuals thus involved and impoverished
                            many thousands. The number of those who have become indirectly
                            compromised in their failure must be greater still. The share property
                            of those persons entirely vanished. Nun kam hinzu 10% discount enforced
                            during 3 months after the Panic. Impossible to estimate the loss this
                            inflicted. <hi rendition="#u">Hence the general distrust.</hi> No
                            manufacturer or merchant or trader can be certain that a man with whom
                            he deals has not been seriously „hit“ in some Co., or may not be
                            seriously compromised by his transactions with somebody who has been so
                            „hit“; and every one is therefore suspicious and distrustful of those
                            with whom he may come into commercial contact.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The melancholy exposures of the mismanagement of railw.
                            boards have of course enormously added to the evil, though they had
                            perhaps not much to do with it originally. Losses d<ex>er</ex> holders
                            of ordinary stock in 1867 zwischen 15 u<ex>nd</ex> 17 Mill. St., and the losses
                            upon the whole of the railw. stock would probably be at least double
                            that amount. All these things act or react with more or less severity
                            upon ever widening circles. The halfyearly dividends, upon due receipt
                            of which numbers of families were mainly, or, perhaps, wholly dependent
                            for subsistence, most materially reduced or vanished altogether. In all
                            such cases the friends of such families must have become sufferers with
                            them. Shares, bonds, and other securities have been unsaleable, or
                            saleable only at a fearful sacrifice; and, in most cases where that
                            sacrifice, from urgent necessity, has been submitted to, the produce of
                            the sales by the necessity which compelled the sale. The money in those
                            cases has not come upon the market for re-investment, for, if not so
                            absorbed and consumed, it would rather seek safety and comparative
                            unproductiveness in the banks. Hence one source of the enormous
                            accumulations of money in the hands of bankers. Distrust, want of
                            confidence, sends it there and keeps it there. All classes made directly
                            or indirectly partakers in these losses. Everybody has been „pulling
                            up“, reducing his establishment, or economising his expenditure, from
                            want or prudence. Equivocal state of politics in Europe, and
                            consequently unsettled state of commerce all over the Continent, as well
                            as the not satisfactory aspect of things in America, has something to do
                            with the prolongation of this condition of trade, but not much, in
                            comparison with the principal causes. We have enormous accumulations of
                            money in banks, because merchants and traders have no adequate amount of
                            legitimate trade in which to employ it. Commerce contracted in its
                            operations, trade dull, demand slack, credit at a low ebb, confidence
                            checked, because such large numbers of our population reduced and
                            impoverished by enormous losses, which, affecting in the first instance
                            only particular classes, have now in natural course of things, extended
                            to and involved the whole community.</p>

                            of the circular convening the meeting of last week which aroused grave
                            suspicions of unfairness. The circular was dated 14. December, and did
                            not reach its destination until 3 days after, during which interval
                            heavy sales of stock were made, and the decline in market price was
                            singularly rapid. Hence reasonably inferred that these sales, pressed at
                            that particular moment, indicated that priority of information used by
                            some persons behind the scenes.</p>

                            Co. In the last 2 half-years nothing has been charged to revenue for
                            replacement of carriages; but, on the contrary, all that had been so
                            charged to revenue for 4 half-years previously, about £8,000, was
                            written back to the credit of revenue and charged to capital, so that

                            stock, although the traffic of the line now considerably lower than 2
                            years ago. The engineer employed to inspect the rolling stock shows that
                            a large number of the engines are nearly done, and that no less than 100
                            must be replaced out of revenue in the next 5 years.

                                    materials at <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> of the new cost. The total cost of the Caledonian
                                    rolling stock stands in its books at 2,600,000£, of which about

                            do £30 or £50 of work for every £100 stock he receives. Therefore it is

                            formed themselves into a „syndicate“ or club, for the purpose of forcing
                            up the market price of the shares. Plan of the syndicate to „earwig“
                            some of the largest shareholders in the concern, and induce them to
                            enter into written agreements not to sell any shares without the

                            them. Carrying out of this scheme entrusted to Stafford who was to

                            another £1000 when it should reach £1 premium, and a final sum of £2000
                            when it should have risen to £2 premium. The syndicate held regular
                            meetings, and kept a minute book of their proceedings. But where was the

                            discounted by Wilkinson, on behalf of the Co., the proceeds were paid
                            away for the shares. In carrying out the scheme it was necessary, to
                            disguise the transaction, that some of the shares should be bought in
                            the names of other persons than those of members of the syndicate. Dazu
                            Fox introduced his friend Gledstanes, to Mr. Stafford, as a person to
                            whom 500 of the shares to be purchased might be transferred. Mr Fox, to
                            satisfy the scruples of Gledstanes, undertook that the shares should not
                            remain in his name, but be at once transferred to a nominee of the Co.,
                            and that Gled. should not be called upon to pay anything or incur any
                            liability in respect of them. Relying upon this undertaking, Gled.
                            accepted and executed transfers to him from several persons to the
                            number of 500 shares, and at the same time executed transfers of these
                            same shares <hi rendition="#u">in blank</hi>, leaving Stafford to fill
                            in the name of the Co’s nominees. Gled. for some time heard no more of
                            the matter; but, in mean time, shares fell, despite the purchases of the
                            syndicate. This, it is said in the published report, was „in consequence
                            of <hi rendition="#u">sales to the amount of 2000 shares by the chairman
                                of the Co</hi>.“ The shares continuing to fall, the syndicate, on
                            the 27. Jan. 1866, caused the transfers to Gled. to be registered, but
                            did not fill up and register the transfers he had executed in blank, as
                            they had agreed to do; and, consequently, when the Co. failed shortly
                            afterwards, Gled. found upon register and put upon list of
                            contributories. Gled. contended that his name ought to be taken off that
                            list; that the <hi rendition="#u">whole scheme was known to</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">approved by the directors</hi> (was d<ex>en</ex>
                            Chairman nicht verhinderte to sell on his account 2000 shares); that the
                            transfers he had executed to some nominee of the Co. ought to have been
                            registered also. This well between Gled. and his friends of the
                            syndicate; but as between him and the creditors of the Co., the Master
                            of the Rolls „could not see it“. The syndicate purchased some 5000
                            shares and „<hi rendition="#u">let in</hi>“ <hi rendition="#u">all the
                                friends</hi> in whose names they caused them to be registered.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">The scientific demonstration of the worthlessness of iron
                            rails as compared m<ex>it</ex> steel does not practically affect trade.
                            The former are still ordered largely, even for countries where steel
                            rails could be delivered at little additional cost. Small proportion,
                            do., of Bessemer steel rails purchased by home lines. The high price of
                            steel rails enhances greatly the difficulty in extending their use and
                            introduction, and as now iron rails can be had at £2 to £2. 10s. per ton
                            in exchange for old rails (weight for weight), iron seems likely to
                            maintain its footing for some time. Wrought iron rails are still in
                            existence which have lasted 20 years and upwards, even on main lines,
                            and it is therefore not impossible to make them of good quality.
                            Deteriorations introduced partly due to the wretched quality of the mode
                            of payment proffered in exchange. However bad the iron rails, yet
                            exceeded in many instances where they are now complained of by the paper
                            money which paid for them. The steel trade in its infancy, and some of
                            the new methods of producing first class cheap steel will become more
                            formidable competitors in the rail trade of this country then hitherto

                            is the competition that even in ordinary years they are employed but
                            little more than half their time. During the past year (1867) 5s. a week
                            has been considered tolerably fortunate.“ The Silk weavers have been for
                            years in a chronic state of distress. The men’s nominal wages are 12s.
                            but their real earnings do not average more than 6s. a week. The cabinet
                            makers of the Kingdom are set down as earning 30s. a week, but those at
                            the East End of London, a very numerous body, are in the „slop trade“,
                            and are ground down by the Jew dealers, who own what are called the
                            „slaughter-houses“, in which advantage is taken of the necessities of
                            the small „garret masters“, many of whom are not earning more than 7s.
                            6d. p<ex>e</ex>r week. „None but those who have examined the facts“,
                            sagt Baxter, „can have any idea of the precariousness of employment in
                            our large cities, and of the large proportion of their time in which
                            they are out of work, or of the loss of time in many well paid trades
                            from drinking habits.“ Those drinking habits are a fearful evil,.. but,
                            sagt d<ex>ie</ex> Mon. M<ex>ar</ex>k<ex>e</ex>t Rev., we have a strong
                            impression that much of this evil arises <pb n="27"/> partly from
                            overwork and underfeeding, and partly from the bad ventilation and bad
                            drainage of the localities in which they are compelled to reside.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Do all these figures and details, sagt M. M. R., furnish
                            us with what they profess to give – namely an account of our national
                            income as a nation? We are bound to say that they do not. „We are“, says
                                <hi rendition="#u">Times</hi>, „all living upon one another, and
                            each income is spent in making up a number of other incomes, and every
                            shilling of each passes through 50 other incomes and contributes to
                            swell them in the course of 1 year.“ To add up all these several incomes
                            into a grand total, and call it the total or gross income of the nation,
                            is merely to foster a delusion. A landowner with £5,000 a year might
                            just as well add up the wages of his steward and household, the rents of
                            his tenantry, and the profits of his tradespeople to make up an income
                            of £20,000 a year. The net actual income of an individual shown by the
                            total amount of his receipts after deducting all the necessary outgoings
                            for keeping up the estate or source of his income. And the net annual
                            income or wealth of a nation shown by the net amount in hand after
                            deducting all the necessary outgoings for the maintenance of its State
                            and the sustenance of its people. Dazu other facts to be considered,

                        <p rend="justify">On the Metropolitan engines and carriages now in use
                            heavier and more expensive than on any line in U. Kingd. except the
                            North London Railw. Consequent upon this, the permanent way is <hi rendition="#u">more expensive in first cost</hi>, and it <hi rendition="#u">suffers more from wear and tear</hi>. The
                            Metropolitan engines weigh 42 tons: of this weight 32 tons are placed on
                            4 wheels, being at rate of 16 tons per pair of wheels. On the London and
                            North Western line the most powerful engines weigh considerably <hi rendition="#u">under 30 tons</hi>, which are distributed over 6
                            wheels, being less than 10 tons per pair of wheels. Again, the
                            Metropolitan passenger carriages weigh 16 tons empty, and they carry 48
                            first class and 70 second and third class passengers. Taking 2 of the
                            second and third class carriages to 1 of the former, average about 63
                            passengers to each carriage weighing 16 tons. On the North Western, the
                            Brighton, and some other lines, the passenger carriages weigh about 6
                            tons and carry 24 first class, 40 second class, and 50 third class
                            passengers. This gives average of 38 passengers to 6 tons of weight, or
                            6.33 passengers per ton, as compared with 63 passengers to 16 tons, or
                            less than 4 passengers per ton in the carriages of the Metropolitan.
                            Taking the number of passengers actually carried on the Metropolitan,
                            rate of <hi rendition="#u">dead weight</hi> hauled as against <hi rendition="#u">paying load</hi> is as 8 to 1 or 87<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> p. c. In other
                            words, 8 tons of dead non-paying load is carried to 1 ton of passenger
                            paying load. If the weight of the engine were included in the
                            calculations, dead-weight equal to 12 tons for every single ton of
                            passengers. A London omnibus, which has to travel over all kinds of
                            roads, bad and good, carries 2 tons of passengers and 1 ton of dead
                            weight. No mechanical reason why, allowing extra weight for increased
                            speed, the proportion of paying to dead weight should not be vastly
                            increased.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Twenty years ago Mr. Samuel, the then engineer of the
                            Eastern Counties Railway, called the attention of the directors to
                            importance of the question involved between dead and paying weight. He
                            demonstrated by actual experiments, carried on for 18 months, that the
                            problem could be solved of assimilating the proportions of dead and
                            paying weights at speeds varying from 30 to 50 miles per hour. He did
                            this by his celebrated light engine, <hi rendition="#u">„the
                                Enfield“</hi>. Was disregarded by the Board. Mechanical invention
                            has gone no further in that direction.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">That the dead weight carried by the Metropolitan is
                            destructive to the permanent way is obvious from the facts. The way
                            first laid with iron rails case-hardened. Before long they were so worn
                            that deemed expedient to alter the quality, and steel railways for
                            renewals were obtained from John Brown et Co, Sheffield. These also gave
                            way; other rails for renewals obtained from Ch. Cammell et Co,
                            Sheffield. All this in 5 years, 3 renewals in 5 years over the heaviest
                            portions.</p>

                            executed between the partners of the old firm and the directors of the

                            accessible to intended shareholders; the <hi rendition="#u">deed of

                            </choice> were not likely to realise anything of the kind, and that they
                            might fall short to the extent of 2 or 3 mill., and the partners
                            therefore covenanted with the Co. to make good the too probable
                            deficiency out of their private estates. But this deed stipulated that
                            whatever might be the exigencies of the Co., they should not be entitled
                            to call upon the partners to make good the deficiency before the end of
                            1868. To that provision, <hi rendition="#u">Henry Fond Barclay</hi>,
                            before he consented to join the lim. co., took exception; and to meet
                            these objections, another deed was prepared at the last moment,
                            providing that in certain events the stipulations of that deed in
                            reference to those deficiencies should be in some way modified and
                            relaxed. All this, as Linklater said, showed that the parties were aware
                            at the time of the issue of the prospectus that the statements it
                            contained, and the prospects it held out, were false and delusive and
                            therefore fraudulent.</p>

                            reduced: first, by abolishing the tenders, and next, by amending the
                            construction of the locomotives themselves, so that their weight may not
                            only be lessened, but better distributed. A better distribution of the
                            weights of the boiler over a larger number of wheels, with adjustments
                            to meet and neutralise inequalities in curves and gradients, would
                            prevent injurious impact upon the rails, and so save wear and tear to
                            rails, wheels, and boiler. Every traveller experiences sudden or
                            continuous shocks from the impossibility of engines of ordinary
                            description adapting themselves to surface inequalities. These shocks
                            inflict damage on the rails and to the rolling stock; this is the main
                            cause of the constant necessity for expensive renewals. Mr. Fairlie has
                            produced engines now in operation on the Neath and Brecon Railw., which
                            work without the possibility of such oscillations.</p>

                            recklessly carried on the business etc Admitted by directors that they

                            Petition filed early in December 1867; pressure of business on the Court
                            caused delay. Adroitly seizing this interval of grace, directors, before
                            Court opens again after Christmas, issue a notice, this time proper,
                            convene meeting on 8 Jan. ’68, in order to pass a resolution to wind up
                            the Co. voluntarily; and their notice is accompanied by stamped proxy
                            papers directed to the directors and with postage stamps duly annexed
                            for their return. At this meeting directors obtain bare majority of <hi rendition="#sup">3</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi>; but the
                            petitioners stated on the hearing that proxies were improperly used on
                            behalf of the directors, and thus the resolution was passed. By the time
                            the petition came on for hearing, 15 Feb. ’68, the shareholders, having
                            become alive to their interests, reverse their last decision of 8. Jan.,
                            and support the petition in such numbers that the directors then have
                            but slight majority on their side. Vice Chancellor Stuart expressed
                            himself strongly against directors, made order for winding up the Co. by
                            the Court. Directors appeal. Independent shareholders show majority to
                            oppose appeal. Lord Justices declare shareholders bound by the
                            resolution passed at a meeting held after the petition had been
                            presented, and which, from taking place almost in holiday time, was in

                            actually enforced, in the winding up of a Co. under the Act of 1862, and

                            such liability, whilst it is certain that in this as in every other case
                            the attempt to enforce it will involve the liquidation in very
                            considerable expense and litigation.“</p>

                            malversations: „The various amalgamations to which this bank has been a
                            party are still involved in a cloud of mystery discreditable to those
                            connected with the details.“ The paid up capital set forth in the
                            various balance sheets, and vouched by the auditors, was, in fact, never
                            to paid up. Of the £80,000 to be contributed by the Birmingham and South
                            Staffordshire Bk., a very small proportion was ever received, and other
                            serious deficiencies exist. The circumstances attending the transfer of
                            a large number of shares, transactions in which the funds of the bank
                            have been misapplied and dissipated, open to grave reprehension. The

                            of the bank and of directors and officers of the bank as so called

                            there was no fixed policy for the general extension of irrigation works.
                            Though the Crown succeeded the Co. in 1858, it was not until 1861, that
                            the famine in the North Western Provinces revealed the necessity of

                            extensions of the practice. For the delay in the irrigation of Madras
                            and Orissa, these Cos. not responsible. The character of the works they
                            are constructing make full amends in durability and efficiency. … The
                            Gvt. has decreed the systematic irrigation of India because it is the
                            best security for the public revenue; and these Cos., in the territories
                            which they cover, are providing an indefinite number of canals from
                            several rivers which will provide every acre of every estate, at the
                            hottest seasons, with ample supplies of the fertilising element. … The
                            two great instruments to prevent famines are irrigation and roads,
                            inasmuch as they constitute the means of producing and distributing
                            food. As to roads, the old East India Co. replied, that owing to a want
                            of stone the means of making good roads did not exist. <hi rendition="#u">(in Bengal) </hi>The same thing was said of other
                            provinces. Violent disputes always occurred when the wretched vehicles
                            of the country proceeding in opposite directions met in nullahs –
                            torrents during the monsoons, but narrow gorges in dry seasons – from
                            the impossibility of their passing each other. These natural tracks are
                            gradually being superseded now; and Bengal presents at this time a very
                            different aspect in this particular to what it did 30 years ago. By
                            means of its internal communications, some of which are tidal channels
                            constructed by one of these Cos, stone is being brought into it.</p>

                            Orissa, the Co. have now undertaken extensive works in Orissa, and also
                            in the district of Behar. Great Progress already made in the Orissa

                            </choice>. V<ex>on</ex> 1801–1825 Acts were obtained for 28 more
                            railways. After 1825 the movement quicker. 1845 there were in existence
                            Acts of Parl. for 412 railways, to be constructed at a cost, in round
                            numbers, of £155,000,000. Average of railways up to 1845, not
                            financially prosperous, but then a mania. George Hudson appeared upon
                            the scene, indoctrinated the community m<ex>it</ex> belief that railways
                            were mines of gold. He became chairman of the Midland Railway, of the
                            York and North and Midland of the York, Newcastle, and Berwick, of the
                            Eastern Countries, and others. In that capacity he thought fit to lease
                            at 6% the Birmingham and Bristol, which had never before earned 2%
                            p. a.; and by this lease the value of the share was raised from some 60
                            or 70£ p. share to 150£. Upon the announcement of this lease, the shares
                            in the railway concerned rose <hi rendition="#u">in one day</hi> nearly
                            £50 in market value. Then followed other railway leases. The „Great
                            North of England“ was taken over at 10% p. a., with a corresponding
                            increase in market value, and then the Leeds and Bradford, and the Hull
                            and Selby, likewise at 10%. Next, the Eastern Counties, which had
                            struggled on for years with scarcely a dividend at all, suddenly paid 7%
                            p. a. under Hudson’s magic sway, and the price of the shares rose 3 or
                            4x. But perhaps the most remarkable instance of the effects of his
                            regime was the establishment of a premium of about 28£ p. share upon the
                            Newcastle and Berwick before a sod was turned, and though there was only
                            £2 p. share paid up. These facts were quite enough to send the world
                            mad. It was schön to obtain a profit of £28 in one week by paying £2,
                            and here was the foundation of the railw. mania of 1845. Adopting
                            Hudson’s plan of action, other railw. Cos. followed in his wake, and
                            there stands on record a great battle between the London and
                            Northwestern and the Great Western for possession of the unmade railway
                            from Oxford to Birmingham, the one offering 175% premium for the shares,
                            and the other 50 P. Ct. Then came a host of other leases at fixed rates
                            of guarantee – the Trent Valley; the Lancaster and Carlisle; the Preston
                            and Wyre; the Bolton and Bury; and numerous others. The railway world
                            lost its senses. It was only to buy and to double, treble or quadruple
                            the purchase money. But then supervened a still more questionable class
                            of adventure. Baseless projects were set on foot in all directions. Such
                            a scheme as the „Manchester and Southhampton“, before even the Bill was
                            lodged, and for which an act of Parliament was never obtained, was at £4
                            to £6 premium; while the South Devon, the „Direct Exeter“, the South
                            Wales, and a host of others, some of which had never any real existence,
                            commanded any premium that mad speculation could conjure up. The „South
                            Midland“ – a project for a line from Hitchin to Leicester – stood at 12£
                            premium, the Banburry and Cheltenham at 7 or 8£ Prem., and even the
                            Cornwall at £6 or £7 premium. Great Western shares, with £80 paid, at
                            one period approached the enormous price of £235. London and North
                            Western were at nearly £250; and difficult to say what railway share in
                            the market was not at some ideal premium, on the same scale, and the
                            same false computation of profit. Then came the reaction. Found that the
                            profits upon which Hudson had based his 10% leases and similar
                            arrangements, were wholly imaginary. He paid dividends out of capital,
                            and, to use the words of an official before the <pb n="38"/> Eastern
                            Counties Railw. Investig. Comm., he achieved his purpose by the rule
                            that, „capital was to bear what revenue would not“. Easy to pay
                            dividends on such terms, until public saw that the whole a farce, then
                            down came the entire fabric, involving in utter ruin 1000<hi rendition="#sup">ds</hi> of families.</p>

                            capitalists invited to promote that object. Some proposed the West

                            north-westerly direction, from Tomah, on the south east, where it

                            Minnesota, where the great railways of the West concentrate. It passes
                            through a fine farming country in a high state of cultivation, as well

                            and the customary demand at this season for our harvest operations. The
                            demand for harvest purposes have been earlier than usual, heavier than
                            usual, and more universal and less gradual than usual, because such has

                            whether external or internal, with a rise in value of money, and a fall
                            in the prices of all ordinary investments. Stupid investors, whenever

                            produce it, as in this case. Dieser Blödsinn legitimate offspring of the

                            1866–67 over that of 1865–66, the expenditure of capital advanced much
                            more rapidly, and consequently the payment of interest by the State
                            become far more onerous upon the state than in the previous year. The
                            Revenue of 1865–66 exceptionally increased by the traffic in cotton from
                            the interior to the coast under the stimulus of the high prices in U.
                            Kingd. and the attendant mania in India. This stimulus removed, the
                            traffic of the railways relapsed into its normal condition. The wonder
                            is that the traffic was so well supported in the latter year.</p>

                            liquidators, the Co. formed in June, 1865. Projector: James Clifford
                            Hodges. Objects proposed: acquisition of leasehold and real property in
                            City and elsewhere for the purpose of making a profit by them, but not
                            clear in what way the profit was to be made. The immediate and real
                            object of its formation was the purchase and taking over of several
                            heavily mortgaged properties belonging to Hodges and which Hodges did
                            not know how to dispose of advantageously. Shares, allotted in July;
                            only 5,925 taken up; total amount, therefore, of paidup capital with
                            which the Co. commenced operations, only £11,850; but that was of no
                            consequence. If they had not paid up capital they had unpaid capital,
                            for which the shareholders would be liable, and they had besides the
                            credit of a corporate company which they could utilise by the creation
                            and issue of debentures and bills. No sooner was the Co. constituted
                            than <pb n="42"/> the directors contracted with Hodges for the purchase
                            of his properties, – certain houses in the City, and some building land
                            at Clapham and Balham, for £65,712 paid to him – after deduction of
                            £27,800, for which they were in mortgage – partly in cash and partly in
                            debentures and acceptances. In a few months, and still having no more
                            than their original amount of capital, they contracted m<ex>it</ex> Sir
                            M. Peto for the purchase of an estate known as the Spread Eagle
                            property, in Gracechurch street, for £100,000. They had no money to pay
                            even the deposit, but had convenient bankers, who lent them £10,000 for
                            the purpose. Purchase not completed, because they were unable to find
                            the remaining £90,000; contract ultimately cancelled, the Co. forfeiting
                            £6,120 of the deposit, besides paying the law expenses. Nevertheless,
                            early in 1866, they agreed to purchase an estate at Holloway, but were
                            unable to complete the contract, it ended in forfeiture of £100. In
                            March, 1866, they took a lease of some ground in Philpot-lane, at a
                            rental of £750 a year, and agreed in expending £5000 in building
                            thereon. Put up building, for which builder now claims £8000, and for
                            which he holds possession of the premises, said not likely to realise £.
                            5000.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">One of the properties purchased from Hodges a building
                            lease of a house in Limestreet, to which was attached a condition in
                            favour of an existing tenant. Premises were rebuilt without any regard
                            to rights of this tenant; consequence action of trespass and action of
                            ejectment, compromised by agreement to pay £1,100 as compensation. But
                            the £1100 never paid, constitute a claim against the Co. which awaits
                            the decision of the court. But the reckless improvidence of these
                            directors did not end here. On portions of the Balham estates they
                            granted building leases, engaging to make advances to the builder as the
                            works progressed. Thus they advanced £5000 to one builder, which amount
                            they borrowed from the first mortgage of the property for the purpose,
                            giving him, as further security, the building agreements. Of another
                            portion of their property, for which they had paid £16,000, they did not
                            make a single shilling of rent or profit during the whole of the 14
                            months’ of the Co’s existence. Yet were borrowing large sums, thousands
                            of £, all this time to take up their acceptances; at the rate of 21%
                            p. a.! Some of these bills entrusted to Hodges to get discounted, and of
                            the produce of them nearly £1000 still unaccounted for. Since the
                            commencement of the liquidation Hodges has become bankrupt, little
                            chance of the amount ever being repaid. Two of these acceptances for
                            £1000 each were handed for discount to a firm in whose hands there was
                            an overdue promissory note for £1,500 of the Hill Pottery Co., some of
                            the directors of which Co. were also directors of the General Estates
                            Co. The acceptances and promissory notes respectively bore the
                            endorsement of the several persons who were directors of both cos., and
                            on this ground the discounters claimed the right to deduct the £1,500,
                            the amount of the overdue note, v<ex>on</ex> d<ex>en</ex> £2,000, the
                            amount of the acceptances, and sent a cheque for the balance only.
                            Liquidators hope to compel these persons to restore the £1,500, with
                            interest. That question stands for decision of the Court next term.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Two of the original directors retired soon after the
                            formation of the Co; 4 others have since retired and become bankrupts;
                            the projector is a bankrupt, and the managing director has compounded
                            with his creditors; the bankers have obtained judgement against the Co.
                            for £10,000; the mortgagees are in possession of the various properties;
                            debts and liab. about £100,000; assets, whether anything or nothing,
                            problematical. Main asset seems to be the uncalled capital, the whole of
                            which the Master of the Rolls has ordered to be called up, and the value
                            of that may be judged by fact that call of £2 p. share in 1866 realised
                            the sum of £110 only. Much litigation has been, will be more in the
                            affairs of the Co. Most of solvent shareholders sold out when they saw
                            what Co. they were in. But they were caught. Most of the shares they
                            sold were bought by Hodges, the projector, to keep up the price of the
                            shares in the market. When the winding up order came, discovered that,
                            though Hodges had bought the shares and had them duly transferred to
                            him, he had never registered the transfers. The names of the former
                            holders therefore still upon the register of shareholders, daher
                            transferred to the official list of contributories. Have their remedy
                            against Hodges, but Hodges bankrupt. Such things impossible, if shares
                            fully paid up and issued „to bearer“.</p>

                            payment, had sworn distinctly, that statement in prospectus, that Lane,
                            Hankey et Co had made profits during 6 years previous to 1865, was
                            false, for they were in 1865 hopelessly insolvent, had been so for
                            years, annual losses instead of profits making. He further deposed on
                            oath that on 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> May 1866, at office of the
                            Co., H. E. Chapman informed him that the firm of Lane, Hankey et Co
                            ought to have stopped payment in 1861; that when he (Chapman) joined
                            them in June 1863, the said R. S. Lane declared there was £65,000
                            capital in the concern, „instead of which there was £75,000 the other

                                    decarbonises the metal by forcing through the converting vessel,
                                    in which it is fluid, powerful jets of atmospheric air, the
                                    oxygen in which produces combustion of the carbon contained in

                                    unexceptionable metal by this process. Puddling unless perfectly
                                    efficient, will yield a product comparatively fibreless. In

                                    contains, and it supersedes altogether the process of puddling.
                                    This done, not by the mechanical application of atmospheric air,
                                    but by the chemical effect of nitrate of soda in the „patent
                                    converter“. A mixture of crude nitrate of soda, with siliceous
                                    sand, being introduced into the converter, a reaction speedily
                                    commences. Nitrous flames escape, with copious fumes produced by
                                    the escape of steam, that carry away in suspension a portion of
                                    the flux. Then follows an intense deflagration; and, when all is
                                    over, and the converter emptied of its contents, the produce of
                                    steel is found to have its impurities eliminated, while carbon
                                    reduced to requisite proportion. The chemical operation is this:
                                    The nitric acid in the nitrate imparts oxygen to the impurities
                                    in the iron, and converts them into compounds with the sodium,
                                    and they are carried off with the sodium in the slag. The action
                                    of the sodium is a great advantage over the oxydising methods in

                                lausige Bedenken. The crude steel produced by the use of nitrate of
                                soda is described as of extremely crude quality, containing hardly
                                more than 97% of pure iron, and nearly 2% of carbon.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">Falsch. The crude steel contained a good deal less
                                than 2% of carbon; and, when it was converted into steel iron, less
                                than 1% of carbon. <hi rendition="#u">„Engineering“</hi> has omitted
                                to state what amount of sulphur was removed by the process, while,
                                if any phosphorus was left in the crude steel, it was obviously not
                                such as to injure the quality. <hi rendition="#u">„Engineering“</hi>
                                next says that phosphorus and sulphur are removed in puddling steel,
                                and that the puddling process is cheaper than the use of nitrate.
                                Statement incorrect. Besides, the great <hi rendition="#u">waste of
                                    iron in puddling</hi> omitted from the calculations. The
                                commoner ores, fullest of the impurities of sulphur and phosphorus,
                                have not all their phosphorus and sulphur removed by puddling. They
                                cannot be removed by mechanical operations only.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">Only the purest ores are available for the Bessemer
                                process. The Heaton supersedes puddling altogether, thus supersedes
                                much expensive labour, utilizes the poorest ores, deprives them of
                                their impurities more effectually than manualwork, with little or no
                                waste of metal in the operation. Another allegation is that nitrate
                                steel is not more uniform in quality than puddled steel. But it is
                                uniform; puddled steel extremely inequal in quality, taking large
                                quantities. With respect to the proportion of slag to the yield of
                                crude steel, Prof. Miller calculated that the maximum could not have
                                exceeded 23% of the weight of the molten metal experimented upon, so
                                that the 12.6% of iron in the slag could not be more than 3% of the
                                iron operated on. Mr. Heaton has since ascertained by direct
                                experiment that the quantity of slag produced is but <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> of the
                                amount estimated by Dr. Miller as the possible maximum; but, then,
                                Heaton no longer uses an admixture of lime. The percentage of iron
                                lost in conversion does not, therefore, exceed 1%.</p>

                            <p rend="justify">The Indian Gvt. has been forced by public opinion to
                                give a great expansion to the practice of irrigation. As a rule
                                better that the Gvt. should be the direct seller of the water,
                                because it can adapt the price to the charge made for the land <hi rendition="#u">in such modes that the cultivator will be obliged
                                    to take the water</hi>. It was clumsy contrivance that Cos. with
                                unguaranteed capital should first sell the water to the Gvt., and
                                then the Gvt. to the cultivator. In the event of a failure of crops
                                from want of irrigation, the Gvt. thus escaped its responsibilities.
                                The Gvt. policy not always consistent in the matter of the Orissa
                                works. At their commencement, and for some time afterwards, the Co.
                                received the cooperation of the Gvt., which was cordially rendered.
                                But, whether from the growth of conviction that irrigation ought to
                                be the sole work of the Gvt., or from the feelings excited in
                                consequence of the failures in the crops having produced famine,
                                this cooperation began to be given in a perfunctory way, and at the
                                present time it cannot be calculated upon. The East India Irrigation
                                Co. has a right to complain of this change. But, on the other hand,
                                the Gvt. complain of the delay which has occurred in the execution
                                of some of the works undertaken by the Co., and forming part of
                                their whole scheme; because, after all, the ultimate responsibility
                                of disaster from the state of crops falls upon the executive. Before
                                matters arrived to this point (wo Gvt. offers to undertake the
                                whole) the directors reported to the proprietors that the completion
                                of the several sections of the Orissa works would cost £1,500,000.
                                But early in the present month the chief Engineer in India reported
                                that £420,000 must be added to this estimate. The capital of the Co.
                                being £1,000,000, it follows that £920,000 more required before the
                                works undertaken can be completed. Though an area of acres 700,000
                                would be irrigated by this expenditure, the works could not be
                                completed without the money, and, meanwhile, the call for their
                                completion is urgent, under a sort of pressure impossible to resist.
                                The directors applied to the shareholders to supply new capital, but
                                subscriptions little more than £70,000, the payment of which
                                extended over 4 years, while the balance of unexpended capital in
                                England had been reduced to £33,000. Demonstrated by this fact that
                                further share capital not to be raised.</p>

                                Lancashire, is not only not flourishing, but the reverse. It has
                                been so ever since the great fall in values, since the termination

                                since the Indian mutiny. The profits realised during the American
                                war were spasmodic and unnatural, and the immense fortunes then
                                accumulated, have since all been more than lost, and have been
                                succeeded in Lancashire by a period of reverses unknown even during
                                the cotton famine. Estimating all the charges upon shipments to our

                                favoured by the low rates of freights now ruling, the prices
                                obtainable at all the ports show a considerable loss of shipments
                                now made, and there is no experience to show that the present is a
                                less favourable time for ventures than any previous time of this
                                year.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">The present position of manufacturers is almost
                                ruinous, as a profit upon production is rendered impossible from the
                                high rates current for the raw material; and so hopeless seems the
                                prospect of relief by a real <ex>i</ex>mprovement in the demand that

                                admitted to be the only means of bettering their condition, an
                                alternative never necessary in ordinary times, and only resorted to
                                at the last extremity.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">Question: If the trade is an unsound one, why are the
                                returns not only kept up, but increased? The answer is: Chiefly for
                                financial purposes. There being no healthy demand for consumption,
                                the <hi rendition="#u">new and increased exports are for the purpose
                                    of providing for previous engagements falling due</hi>. A good
                                portion of the trade is also contributed by producers, who, being
                                unable to find a market for the whole of their production, and being
                                too poor to hold, consign the remainder, upon which they are
                                accommodated with partial advances through the commission agent or
                                intermediate man, who knows that someone must suffer, and provides
                                on the contingency not falling upon himself.

                            <p rend="justify">„The enormous increase in the number of foreign loans
                                recently negotiated or introduced in this country, and the small
                                denomination of the bonds into which it is the modern practice to
                                divide them, have multiplied the inconvenience and risk attending
                                the present mode of settlement to so great an extent that it is
                                believed no time should be lost in devising an adequate remedy. At
                                present, after the clerks have reduced the account as much as
                                possible in the limited space they have at their disposal, the
                                balances remaining open are settled by delivery from A to B, from B
                                to C, and so on, till the ultimate buyer is reached, so that the
                                same bond frequently passes through 30, 40, or even 50 hands. To
                                prove that this is no exaggeration we have only to look in busy
                                times at the names on the back of a ticket in Consols, or in any of
                                the principal Railways. These will be found frequently with 50 names
                                on them. One result is that transactions, which could probably be
                                adjusted by the passing of cheques to the amount of perhaps 2 or 3
                                millions £, involve now settlements to the average amount of 13
                                millions, as <hi rendition="#u">the figures of the Clearing House
                                    show</hi>. This value of 13 millions, however, represents but a
                                portion of the total values passed under the present system; each of
                                the leading jobbers’ office is, in itself, a small clearing house; a
                                large delivery of Turks, f. e., made to him on the one hand, might
                                and is often compensated, by a counter delivery of Italians on the
                                other side. It is impossible to arrive at the amount of stock
                                actually passed on the settling day, but the experience of the
                                writer’s own office shows that the nominal amount of stock passed <choice>
                                    <sic>exceed</sic>
                                    <corr cert="high">exceeds</corr>
                                </choice>, by 3 or 4 ×, the cash balances adjusted.“</p>
                            <p rend="justify">The hurry and confusion which attach to this system
                                are therefore due to the fact that all bargains are adjusted between
                                each actual buyer and seller, although the same bonds may have
                                changed ownership many times during the „account“. Common sense
                                would suggest that this cumberous plan might be obviated, as is done
                                in the transfer of registered securities, by placing the <hi rendition="#u">original seller</hi> and the <hi rendition="#u">ultimate buyer</hi> in immediate communication. But in the
                                Stock Exchange, as in all other businesses, the credit of
                                individuals differs largely, and the broker who deals readily with
                                one firm in £100,000 stock might be chary of dealing with others in
                                £100. Brokers who transact large operations naturally object,
                                therefore, to forego the security they have in dealing with first
                                class firms, and do not care to accept payment instead from
                                individuals of whose standing they are ignorant. This difficulty
                                might be avoided by adopting the ordinary course of procedure in
                                bill transactions – viz, rendering each endorser personally liable.
                                Such rule once established, the first broker on the Stock Exchange
                                could have no objection to accept the „name“ or „ticket“ of any
                                member, knowing that in case of default of the ultimate buyer, he
                                would have immediate redress from the parties to whom he originally
                                sold, and with whose endorsements he accepted the ticket.</p>

                                turned, than merchants and others under engagements become still

                                Hence the upward movement receives a further temporary impetus.
                                Ferner: At this time of the year, the tendency of the rates of
                                discount at the present period of the year is always almost towards
                                firmness. Some of the banks help the market up by following the very
                                absurd practice of restricting advances in order to show large
                                reserves in their forthcoming reports. Customers also assist the
                                movement by seeking discounts for the mere purpose of increasing
                                their balances at the close of the year.</p>

                                last year, while our current imports exceed those of that period
                                (1867). The importers have to a very unusual extent deferred their
                                payments, so that remittances for the next few weeks must be heavy,
                                and the more so as 12 Mill. $ to 14 M<ex>ill</ex>. $ have to be
                                remitted against the coupons of foreign bondholders. Our foreign
                                merchants are extensively „short“ in gold, having sold in
                                anticipation of a decline to follow the elections and the active
                                forwarding of the cotton crop. Advices from Europe indicate the
                                probability of higher rates of interest at the Banks of England and
                                France; which would check the demand for our securities abroad, and
                                tend to attract gold in that direction. It may be owing to that
                                tendency that so few of our bonds are going out in return for the
                                November coupons.</p>

                                the very persons who originated the Cos. and conducted them to ruin
                                – imperatively requires that some means should be devised for
                                protecting the unfortunate shareholders against calls and demands
                                which, in too many instances, are both unreasonable and unlawful. In

                                proceedings are being procrastinated and the costs of winding up

                                Apparent difficulty to discover a sufficient average against loss,
                                so as to ascertain the exact risks of the Assurers. Prosecuting his
                                inquiries during long period, and carefully examining all the
                                conditions that lead to loss of life and property in coal mines, he
                                ascertained <hi rendition="#u">that such a recurrence of
                                    accidents</hi> prevailed as indicated the operation of a law
                                uniform in its action when spread over a long period. Though
                                apparently capricious and irregular, colliery accidents, when
                                examined over a long period, are found subject to averages exactly
                                as vital <supplied cert="high">as</supplied> statistics are; and,
                                assured of this, they certainly ought to be provided against in the
                                same way. Bradley further discovered, that from all causes there are
                                annually not less than 900 accidents involving the loss of life, and
                                that about 1000 colliers are killed every year. With great labour,
                                but within very small limits of error, the costs of accidents from
                                explosions, fires, fall of roofs, inundations, and breaking of
                                machinery, have also been ascertained. In 1865 there were 3,268
                                collieries in U. Kingd., employing 307,542 miners, who produced
                                98,150,587 tons of coal, valued at the pit’s mouth, at £24,537,646.
                                Small premium upon either of these large quantities would be
                                sufficient to produce an income to defray the costs of accidents to
                                property, and to support the widows and children of the miners
                                killed until in situation to provide for themselves. … In
                                collieries, the supervision exercised by an Insurance Co. would be
                                an addition to the means of providing against accidents.</p>

                            <p rend="justify">Mr. William White, a banker of 40 years standing, has
                                published in one Manchester paper, about this subject. Nach ihm
                                viele Banks „<hi rendition="#u">are buying their own shares to keep

                            <p rend="justify">The banks which buy up their own shares will generally
                                take care to have them registered in the name of nominees, so that
                                the transaction may not appear upon the register.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">Limited banks are required by law to exhibit at their
                                head office a statement of their assets and liabilities according to
                                a prescribed form „or as near thereto as circumstances will
                                permit.“; and some avail themselves of this liberty to vary the form
                                thus as to conceal the amount of their overdrawn accounts by
                                blending them into one item with bills of exchange, or by merely
                                stating the whole of their assets in one sum. In either case the
                                real position of the bank not seen. Uniformity of accounts is as
                                much required in other joint stock banks as in Railw. Cos. Sir
                                William Hutt’s bill would have given us this uniformity; but that
                                Bill, instead of being supported by Board of Trade with all the
                                weight of Government, was opposed by that Board, and consequently
                                withdrawn.</p>
                            <p rend="justify">The great vice of „Lancashire banking“, White says,
                                „is making large advances to customers on overdrawn accounts,
                                thereby locking up the capital of the <choice>

                                </choice>, and jeopardising their very existence.“ And the <hi rendition="#u">auditing</hi> of some of the banks accounts seems
                                to be equally lax and perilous. „I have now lying before me“, says
                                White, „the reports of 2 banks, in one of which <hi rendition="#u">two of the directors have kindly audited their own

                                mentions two other bank reports „in which the rebate on bills on

                                profit and loss account.“ Such things could not occur in the midst
                                of a great mercantile community like Lancashire, if the leading
                                members of that community were prompt to expose and denounce them.

                            <p rend="justify">From underneath the soil of Ballarat gold to amount of
                                £40,000,000 was extracted. From one little plot, a little over 600
                                yards in breadth, now situate in the very centre of the town, with
                                several streets crossing it, £750,000 rewarded the diggers’ search.
                                This is going on to the present day, only that shafts have taken the
                                place of <hi rendition="#u">‚holes’</hi>, and expensive machinery
                                been substituted for the pick and washpan of the first explorers.
                                The operations of the various Cos. which have worked on Ballarat
                                ground have had the effect of distinctly marking out the track which
                                the main lead of gold and its various tributaries have taken. In
                                certain directions, indeed, the houses would have spread faster were
                                it not for the almost certainty that gold lies beneath the surface,
                                for which shafts must be sunk and machinery be erected before the
                                space is encumbered with buildings. In a plot of ground on the

                                found to run, dipping to a considerable depth, on which operations
                                have been already commenced, it has <pb n="58"/> therefore been
                                decided to mine on a scale hitherto not attempted in the colony of
                                Victoria, so that the gold may be brought to the surface in the
                                shortest possible time, and the ground revert to agricultural or
                                building purpose. Land is too valuable close to Ballarat to be
                                hampered with mining operations longer than is absolutely necessary.
                                This undertaking will require larger instant outlay than the
                                locality can well manage; very early in 1869 John Bull’s Packet will

                                principally of dummies or imitation goods made of plaster of Paris;

                                land) would be indefinitely to increase the security of his
                                investment, by removing all difficulties about title; by enabling
                                him to grant any kind of lease he pleased, whether wasteful or not;
                                and by facilitating sale whenever he wanted his money, or part of
                                his money, back again. … Land might be raised in price, doubtless
                                would be, but the richest would get, just as in open market they get
                                everything else. The poor might as well compete with them for coals.
                                Even with perfect freetrade, the dealer always prefers „a large
                                order“, and a visibly solvent customer … It is conceivable, that if
                                the labourers desired the land energetically, a class of land
                                pawnbrokers would spring up as in India and Southern France, who
                                would buy for the labourers, and exact, in the form of interest on
                                mortgages, an excessive rental from the cultivator … In Yorkshire
                                agricultural labourers are greatly in advance of wages in the South,
                                owing to the competition of other modes of livelihood.

                            <p rend="justify">L. Bonaparte has borrowed upwards of £100,000,000, or
                                at the rate of about 6 Mill. £ a year for every year of the Empire …
                                On 27. Jan. (’68) Magne announces new loan of 440 Mill. fcs (nearly
                                18 Mill. £ St.) to be raised by open loan, in instalments spread
                                over 20 months, and to involve at the price of the day an addition
                                of 25 or 26 Mill. £ to the National Debt. … The Emperor’s system of
                                open loans has produced one very remarkable effect unknown … except
                                in France. The worse the price of Rentes, the more readily money
                                comes into a loan. The real subscribers under this system are the
                                better off peasantry and small bourgeoisie, who scarcely recognise
                                any forms of permanent investment except land and Rentes; who look
                                to interest rather than to the principal, and consider that a low
                                price is „very liberal of the Emperor.“ Just as in England a fall of
                                Consols below a certain point, z. B. 87 – is always the signal for a
                                rush of <hi rendition="#u">bona fide</hi> purchasers; so in France,
                                an open loan under 70 will be far more rapidly taken up than one
                                above it. An Englishman would think it less secure, but that is not
                                the French peasant’s mode of calculating.</p>

                            October, actually signed on Octob. 30, there were one or 2 material
                            alterations. The contract prices were <hi rendition="#u">„somewhat“</hi>
                            (Peto’s expression) higher. The rate per mile for the permanent way,
                            f. i., was increased from £5,107 to £6,180, a <hi rendition="#u">rise of
                                20 P. Ct.</hi> More important still, the provision that the Co. were
                            to take the shares <hi rendition="#u">at par</hi> was <hi rendition="#u">omitted from the signed contract</hi>, an omission for which Peto
                            cannot give any reason. There was another point in the agreement. The
                            contractors were to pay a guaranteed interest of 6 P. Ct. on the B
                            shares, half the total number, during the construction of the line,
                            though Peto could not say whether he was aware at the time that the <hi rendition="#u">Act prohibited „the payment of interest or dividend
                                out of money raised or borrowed.“</hi> The Legislature never
                            authorised a certain capital on the understanding that 25 P. Ct. would
                            be absorbed in discounts for placing the shares and debentures.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">An important part of the plan was the <hi rendition="#u">‚placing’ of the shares and debentures</hi>, which necessarily
                            brought in the general public. Without their aid the combination must
                            have failed, for the contractors never contemplated being the holders of
                            the line they made. Peto says he was not responsible for the Prospectus
                            issued to the public. He „only“ „revised it to see that his interests
                            were protected.“</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The <hi rendition="#u">first</hi> offer to the public was
                            of B Shares, on which there was a guaranteed interest, and the
                            Prospectus told them that the A Shares were all taken. In fact, the A
                            shares had not been taken, but only subscribed for. So the B shares and
                            debentures were all got rid of <hi rendition="#u">at par</hi>. At one
                            place, Peto speaks vaguely of the changes incidental to placing so large
                            an amount of capital, and he also describes an arrangement with <hi rendition="#u">Knight and Coleman</hi>, the Co’s brokers, who were
                            „associated with a large number of brokers“, by which they were to get
                            10 P. Ct. for their share in the business of „placing.“ Business
                            succeeded, money was got. Deceit of the public, misinformed as to the A.
                            shares, paid interest on B shares so as to induce them to take them up,
                            not cognisant of the Discount arrangements.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">What became of the A Shares? They could hardly be disposed
                            of at all. In July, 1862, Peto proposed that he should get a rebate of
                            50 P. Ct. on account of their „postponement.“ Ultimately they were
                            purchased at 37£ 10s. Peto explains, he was to have a commission of 25
                            P. Ct. on the whole capital, and the purchase of the A shares at 37<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> 10s. „would make the commission larger, the
                                <hi rendition="#u">nominal capital</hi> on these shares being
                            £850,000.“ Although he only gets 37<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> 10s., Peto
                            still deducts 25£., his commission being on the „whole capital.“ In
                            other words, whatever the sum of cash got, his commission remains the
                            same, and it must have amount on the Ashares to more than 50 P. Ct. The
                            upshot was, that out of the total authorised capital of £2,200,000 only

                            the most formidable difficulties was the necessity of a subscription

                            shares. But whence came the money? On the same day, on which he paid the
                            money, he got from the Railw. Directors 100,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, and on the following day 51,000<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>

                            from 30 to 40 Pct. But potatoes have also risen, and in far more than

                            amount of cotton in the market. It requires all „warehousers“ of cotton
                            (a term which is defined, as every person and Corporation having cotton
                            in his or their possession at any port in the U. Kingd.) to make a
                            return of 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> July of every year of the
                            quantity of cotton in their possession; and every „forwarder“ of cotton
                            – i. e. „every person and Corporation who carries or forwards cotton for
                            toll or other consideration“ is required to make a return <hi rendition="#u">monthly</hi> of all cotton ‚forwarded or received by
                            him within the preceding month. The effect of the Act, therefore, is,
                            that on 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> next July authentic account of
                            cotton now at hand at Liverpool and the other ports and by a similar
                            account we shall also know how much is monthly subtracted from that
                            store and how much is added to it. We shall have a certified amount to
                            begin with, and be sure of all the changes.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">These accounts are „compulsory“. If any „warehouser“ or
                            „forwarder“ fails to make them, he is to be liable to fine for each
                            neglect. Some objection is taking to this as rendering trade no longer

                            the capitalist’s side and bestowing extra care on the work. They had the
                            power to throw away nearly all the profits by carelessness and
                            indifference.</p>

                            secured in any way. The firm can do each year what they please about it,
                            and for all practical purposes the Briggs are the firm – the public and
                            the workmen do not count.</p>

                            make the holding of shares a real part of the programme, desire to keep

                        <p rend="justify">The ‚Artisans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings Bill’ is the first
                            of a series which is likely to be a long one. … The price of houseroom
                            in the great cities, and more especially in London, has increased with
                            the increase of their population, until the poorer sort of labourers,
                            the men who earn from 12s. to 18s. a week, are wholly unable to pay the
                            sum demanded for lodgings of any decent kind. That sum is usually <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> of their
                            incomes, and if the family is large even more, and the labourer is
                            tempted to reduce it by every possible device. Either he retreats to a
                            room so unsafe, illprovided, or unhealthy, that it is let cheap, or he
                            takes in lodgers who pay a portion of his landlord’s demand … The
                            consequence in great cities is that small, rotten, or otherwise cheap
                            houses, near the centres of work, are found crammed to the roofs with
                            families who set all sanitary rules, etc and live, as Lord Chelmsford
                            said, like animals, or, as the Bishop of London still more forcibly put
                            it, like vermin. The landlords or lessees of such houses, very often
                            poor men, spend as little as possible on repairs, dig no cesspools, open
                            no drains, supply no water, and leave as few openings for light and air
                            as they possibly can, windows being conveniences which will break. Such
                            houses become of course centres of disease, depôts where certain forms
                            of fever are storedup to await the first hot day, when they spread far
                            beyond the „rookery“ where they were originally generated.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">It is essential that the State, as guardian of the lives
                            of its subjects, should abolish these pest houses, and expedient that <choice>

                            could plead his right of property in arsenic or prussic acid. He is
                            bound to obey the laws regulating the public health, and is bound also
                            to take heed that his conduct does not lower the general level of
                            morality.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Under this Bill, whenever a house is condemned by
                            competent medical authority as unfit for human habitation, the „local
                            authority“ – that is the Board of Health, or Commission, or Town
                            Council, or Vestry – may direct the owner to make the necessary
                            improvements. If he declines, the local authority may order the House to
                            be closed, or may purchase it on a valuation and rebuild, or may
                            delegate its right of so doing to a speculator in houses. This is the
                            main provision, that a landlord may be compelled to choose between
                            allowing his tenantry habitable accommodation and selling his property
                            to some one who will. Difficulties of the detail. Unless they are
                            removed the Act may prove almost <hi rendition="#u">a dead letter</hi>.
                            In the first place, the Bill gives no security that the „local
                            authority“ will not be entirely in the hands of petty landlords – the
                            class, which of all others, seeks most for municipal office. In that
                            case the Act either inoperative, or will be used to secure high prices
                            for worthless property. In the second place, the Act provides no fund
                            for the work beyond a 2d. rate, which will be insufficient and
                            unpopular, and compel the local authorities either to delegate their
                            right to a builder, or to exert their alternative power of closing the
                            houses altogether. In the former case the builder is pretty certain to
                            look to profit, and put up rooms a little too good for the poor, thus
                            increasing the overcrowding elsewhere; and in the second, the population
                            must be expelled very often by sheer force. Again, the Bill does not in
                            any way prevent overcrowding, for a house may be in a perfectly
                            habitable state for 4 people, and quite uninhabitable for 14. We fear
                            the Act will lead to very little except a few considerable clearances,
                            which will intensify the surrounding misery and disease. The suffering
                            produced by such clearances for the benefit of railways has been already
                            considerable, and threatened once or twice to breed formidable
                            riots.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The evil to be met is a huge one, namely, the inability of
                            London to hold its population until it is raised higher into the air.
                            Way out of the difficulty is an extension of 2 measures already
                            sanctioned by Parliament – the Lodging House Act, and the Act offering
                            loans of money to the builders of houses for the poor. If a properly
                            constituted Authority were allowed to condemn small districts one at a
                            time as unfit for human habitation, and such districts were then cleared
                            by the Dwelling-House Associations, and covered with their lofty
                            dwellings <hi rendition="#u">out of capital lent by the State</hi>, the
                            gradual relief would no doubt be very great – as great, that we might in
                            a few years carry the Lodging House Act to its logical conclusion, and
                                <hi rendition="#u">absolutely prohibit overcrowding beyond the limit

                            work well for Liverpool, Manchester, or Norwich, where local authority
                            strong, and possible to extend the area to be built on.</p>

                            necessity; then those trades suffer too; then the decline in those
                            second trades affects other trades from which they buy; and so a general
                            slowness of commerce and bad remuneration is propagated round the
                            commercial world. But we must not look for the effect as if it were a
                            sudden coup d’état – an instant decline of all things 10%. It is a

                            not pay and never could have paid; that they were not selected because
                            as railways they were likely to be permanently profitable, but because
                            as momentary instruments of speculation they were likely to augment the
                            gains of influential persons. A gvt of new men, a gvt of poor men, and a
                            gvt. with Bourse connections, is always likely to do this.</p>

                            all cases everything must depend on the capitalist, and the giving of a

                            others, the public procedure consequent on the formation of a limited

                            retention of control is the condition precedent of any mixed system of
                            cooperation in which he takes part; but the machinery of an association
                            seems useful in securing all the advantages of a plan for making the

                            important in agriculture – the <hi rendition="#u">mortgagee</hi>. He is
                            to be found wherever land can furnish a valid security for a loan. In
                            countries where the custom of hiring the land of another is unpopular or
                            little practised, he becomes to a great extent the recipient of the
                            rent. Thus in the U. States, instead of letting his land the proprietor
                            sells it out and out, receiving we will suppose 10 P. Ct. money down,
                            and the remainder of his claim in nine annual instalments with interest,
                            retaining his hold upon the land as his security until the debt is fully
                            discharged. In this case, he really receives rent in the shape of
                            interest and capital. The same thing exists in Norway: Land is rarely,
                            if ever, sold in that country for ready money, and the proportion of
                            landed property mortgaged is very large.</p>

                            the worst asset that even the panic of 1866 can show, and no matter what
                            you prove against it you are sure to get nothing.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">As is usual in such cases, there is an unsettled account
                            which might be litigated between the joint estate of the two bankrupts,
                            Peto and Betts, and the estate of the three, Peto, Betts, and Crampton.
                            But it is not worth while litigating it; the estate of Peto, Betts, and
                            Crampton will be still very bad, and if each item is thoroughly argued,
                            the lawyers will have all the money from both estates. If both firms had
                            money in hand, it would have been spent „on law.“ Now as one litigant
                            had no money there has been a compromise.</p>

                            Chairman of the Co. was authorised by the board to sign, and under the

                            however, little more than begun. A concession has been granted for its

                            a term of 18 months being fixed for the completion of the embankment.

                            construction of a line no farther than Tiflis will be sufficient to
                            attract to a Russ. road a considerable transit trade between Northern
                            Persia and Europe, as well as develop the resources of the Province
                            itself. Former: a short branch of about 20 miles from Kiev to the
                            important market of Berdytchef, a branch of the Kiev Balta line, to
                            Volostchisk on the Austrian frontier, at which point it is anticipated a
                            junction will be effected with the Galician railway of Austria; and an
                            extension of the Tiraspol line to Kichinef in Besserabia to be connected
                            ultimately with the Austrian lines through Moldavia. None of these

                            to Helsingfors, which will unite Finland and the line already made there
                            with the rest of the empire.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Perhaps the most important of all in this view is the
                            projected line from Warsaw to Moscow, on which the preliminary works
                            only commenced this year, under the immediate direction of the
                            Government, in consequence of rather a sudden resolution. This is a
                            purely military line, planned to establish a firmer hold on Poland and
                            facilitate military movements against Austria or Prussia.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Taking into consideration the branch from near Kiev to the
                            Galician frontier, there will be 3 railway roads at least from Central

                            the strategical objects of a Russ. railway system cannot but be well
                            provided for. This Moscow and Warsaw line will also provide a short cut
                            from the South of Russia to the German ports on the Black Sea, and even
                            the German Ocean, while the Russians themselves are urging strongly its
                            connection with the Russ. port of <hi rendition="#u">Libau</hi>, which
                            is the only one entirely open throughout the winter. But, on the whole,

                            this renewed devotion to strategical lines. The guarantees on interest
                            are already becoming very serious in amount, and unless met by the
                            productiveness of the lines opened will render the railways altogether
                            rather cumbersome than otherwise to the finances of the empire.</p>

                            should be paid at the rate of 1 Mill. piastres a year <hi rendition="#u">in Mexico</hi>, by means of a public sale of the bonds, the holders

                        <p rend="justify">At The <hi rendition="#u">Imperial Court</hi>, im appeal
                            presented by the Credit Mobilier (i. e. its <hi rendition="#u">directors</hi>) against the judgment of the Tribunal of Commerce,
                            the Advocate General held that the directors, in order to induce the
                            shareholders to double the capital, had made false representations.
                            Z. B. in the transactions with the <hi rendition="#u">Immobilière
                                Company</hi>, the directors had employed „98,000,000 fcs in the
                            acquisition of building grand, for which there were no buyers, and in
                            constructing houses for which there were no tenants, and had afterwards
                            disbursed 100,000,000 fcs to prevent these errors from being seen.“ In
                            the balance sheets there were no traces of these things; on the
                            contrary, the situation was presented as most favourable. In the balance
                            sheet of 31 December, 1865, f. i., the assets were stated to exceed the
                            liabilities by 70,000,000 fcs, of which 60 Mill. fcs were represented by
                            the capital, the rest by the reserve and realised profits. But in
                            reality the capital was absorbed in the advances to the Immobiliere
                            Company, and could not be recovered, existed in fact only on paper; and
                            the liabilities exceeded 180 Mill. fcs, of which a large part were in
                            deposits and the rest in Bourse and other transactions. Moreover,
                            nothing was said of a sum of 46 Mill. fcs due to the Southern Railway
                            Co., though it was liable to be called for every day. For these and
                            other reasons, the Advocate General held that the shareholders had been
                            wilfully misled when they consented to furnish an additional capital of
                            60 Mill. fcs, and that consequently the directors must reimburse the sum
                            with interest. Two of the Directors, Michel Chevalier and Renouard de
                            Bussières, contended, as they did before the Tribunal de Commerce, that
                            they ought to be relieved from liability because they had been kept in
                            ignorance by their colleagues as to the real state of the Co; but the
                            Advocate did not admit their pretension, held another director, the Duc
                            de Galliera, not responsible, not having been present at the meeting at
                            which the doubling of the capital was decided.</p>

                            by cheques and transfers; it requires an actual deposit of coin. The
                            increase in the coin of the Bank o. France is no proof that any coin has

                            districts, displayed anything like the enthusiasm they manifested on
                            former occasions, and have thereby grievously disappointed the
                            expectations that were formed, Bourse speculators, in order to get as
                            large a number as possible of small subscriptions which are <hi rendition="#u">irreductible</hi>, have employed men of straw to
                            subscribe. At Marseilles, it is even stated, one peculiarly sharp fellow

                            several subscriptions of 5f.</p>

                            that the speculating fraternity had a considerable interest in getting
                            into their hands as much of the 5fcs scrip as possible. And to succeed
                            in this object, not only did they employ poor men to subscribe, but by a
                            premium which at one moment was as high as 3f., they induced bona fide
                            subscribers to sell their certificates. When this became known among the
                            lower orders of Paris, a considerable number of men and women hastened
                            to inscribe themselves, and they carried their paper straight to the
                            Bourse for sale. For some days the outside of that famous establishment
                            was quite encumbered with a class of people whose dress and manner
                            proved them to be strangers to the place, and they had no difficulty in
                            making the bargain they sought. But the inevitable result was that the
                            influx of scrip caused the premium to decline, so that the late comers
                            were grievously disappointed about the sum they had counted on. Some of
                            them having very confused notions on the great law of offer and demand
                            were excessively indignant at being told that they must take less than
                            the 3fcs their friends and neighbours had got, and they applied ugly
                            epithets to the buyers who told them so; at one moment, indeed, a band
                            of these got up a little emeute. The upshot of all this is that whereas
                            the Minister of Finance was most desirous to keep his loan in the hands
                            of people of small resources, and the belief that they would hold it
                            permanently as an excellent investment, and whereas he even, after
                            opening the subscription, took special measures for preventing
                            speculators from getting it and from carrying it to market, he has sadly
                            failed. The speculators have obtained the greater part of it, and to the
                            market it will go.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">The Minister of Finance, with that desire for theatrical
                            effect which characterises the French, issued on August 15, because it
                            was the Emperor’s fête, a report on the subscription to the new loan
                            which closed at 5 p.m. on August 13. And yet, seeing that the
                            subscription had been opened in every part of France and in England, it
                            was impossible for him to be in possession of the precise Results. This
                            he himself admits; but the importance of striking the popular
                            imagination on a festive occasion, by the publication of startling
                            figures, outweighed the desire, which, as a financier, he must have
                            felt, to be precise. And startling his figures were: he wanted a capital
                            of 450,500,000 fcs (18,020,000£), representing 19,516,245f. of Three
                            P. Ct. Rente, and the subscription gave him, he says, in round figures,
                            a capital of 15,000 Millions fcs (600 Mill. £ St.) being equal to
                            660,184,270f. rente, nearly 34× more than he demanded. Of the rente (of
                            19,516,245f.) f.3,141,170 were in the minimum subscription of 5f., and
                            were taken by 628,234 subscribers. The rest, amounting to 657,043,100f.
                            was taken by 153,058 persons. The 5f. subscriptions will be accorded
                            entire, but the rest will be reduced pro rata. The amount of cash
                            deposited as guarantee by the subscribers exceeded 660 Mill. f.
                            (26,400,000£.). On these results the minister is triumphant. They
                            surpass, he says, what was attained in any preceding loan, and surpass
                            the last one, that of 1864, by 240,000 in the number of subscribers, 440
                            Mill. f. in the amount of rente subscribed, 430 Mill. f. in the
                            guarantee deposited; 3× the amount of capital. And he draws from these
                            „really unexampled figures“ the conclusion: That the extraordinary
                            desire of the public to obtain the largest part possible in the sum to
                            be divided evidently shows regard being had to the price of issue, that
                            the Credit of the State does <hi rendition="#u">not find in the present
                                rate of the public funds</hi> its true and definitive expression.
                            That the importance of the sums deposited with such facility in the
                            space of a week, and which alone cover almost 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> of the total of the loan, is a
                            sign of an immense force, and gives the highest idea of the accumulated
                            wealth of France; and, lastly, he says in language somewhat awkward,
                            „the most striking manifestation of the grandeur of the country, and of
                            its confidence in itself, in its political institutions, and in the
                            wisdom of the Sovereign.“ But in sober truth considerable abatement must
                            be made from the minister’s exultation. The thing shows ways of <hi rendition="#u">unemployed wealth</hi> and confidence in the public
                            funds as a security. But in great part the subscription quite
                            fictitious, inasmuch as 1000<hi rendition="#sup">nds</hi> of the larger
                            subscribers knew well that they would not get what they demanded, did
                            not want to get it, and would not be able to pay for it if <choice>

                            their names with the intention, not of making a permanent investment,
                            but of realising a small profit by an immediate sale of their scrip at

                            past has been so great that scarcely any investments have been made in

                            manufacturers of Alsace are, he says, cooperating with him, and the

                            Granite Co. was established 2 or 3 years ago to work the granite of a
                            certain small island in the Bristol Channel. Having got into
                            difficulties, there are now 2 petitions for winding it up – the first,
                            presented by the <hi rendition="#u">National Bank of Ireland</hi>, which
                            claims 13,000£; and the second presented by ordinary shareholders, who
                            contest altogether the claim of the National Bank of Ireland and make
                            grave charges against that Bank with relation to the Co. The substance
                            of them is that four at least of the Directors of the Bank „had carried
                            on a species of trade <hi rendition="#u">in launching and winding
                                up</hi> (Worte d<ex>es</ex> Richters) <hi rendition="#u">joint stock
                                companies for their own benefit;</hi> that the Debt claimed by the
                            National Bank was illusory, and such as the shareholders of the Lundy
                            Granite Co. were not legally liable to pay.“. Master of Rolls declares
                            to be there subject of inquiry on the face of it; that „the conduct of
                            the directors of the National Bank could not be conveniently or properly
                            disposed of under a winding-up order obtained by themselves and carried
                            on by themselves. He was satisfied of this – that the Lundy Granite Co.
                            was under the control of the National Bank.“</p>

                        <p rend="justify">„There is a mass of about 20,000,000 of light sovereigns
                            and 5 or 6 Mill. £ in value of half-sovereigns circulating in defiance
                            of the law. This light coin forms almost <hi rendition="#u">a third part
                                of the sovereign circulation</hi> and nearly <hi rendition="#u">a
                                moiety of the half-sovereign circulation;</hi> but being unequally
                            distributed we find that in some of the agricultural districts the
                            proportion of light sovereigns rises to 44 P. Ct. The average of
                            deficiency of the sovereigns is fully ·53 P. Ct., or more than 10s. in
                            100£, while the half-sovereigns are depreciated more than twice as much,
                            or about 24s. in 100£.“</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The first branch of the inquiry relates to the <hi rendition="#u">amount of the coinage</hi>. … The most approved plan
                            has been to assume the probability of a certain amount of coin being in
                            circulation in a given year, add the ascertained amount of coinage from
                            that time, deduct the amount exported and cancelled for lightness, and
                            so arrive at an approximation to the truth. Jevons has applied it with
                            great care to a new subject.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">What Jevons proposed was, to find out the proportion of
                            coins in circulation belonging to each year since <pb n="81"/> 1817, <hi rendition="#u">when the previous coinage was called in</hi>. Though
                            it would not be possible by this means alone to arrive at the amount of
                            the circulation, it would be possible to say what <hi rendition="#u">proportion</hi> of it was derived from the mint-issues of recent
                            years; and this would furnish the means of arriving at the truth. The
                            amount of recent coinage probably circulating may be guessed at with
                            some accuracy, and having previously ascertained its proportion to the
                            whole coinage we may know what the whole is too.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Jevons distributed a circular letter and blank form to a
                            number of bankers and other gentlemen, requesting them to take out one
                            or two hundred sovereigns at random from those received in the ordinary
                            course of business, and count the number of each year. He thus got
                            statistics from every great centre of population in the country, and
                            from every variety of district. – 321 returns in all relating to 213
                            distinct towns and localities; and he received unexpected assistance in
                            his plan. The gentlemen to whom he applied went beyond his requirement;
                            The <hi rendition="#u">Governor of the Bank of Scotland</hi> procuring
                            an enumeration of 48,647 coins at the various branches of the bank, and
                            the <hi rendition="#u">General manager of the London and Westminster
                                Bank</hi> a similar complete return for his district. Altogether he
                            received an enumeration of 90,474 sovereigns and 75,036 half-sovereigns,
                            a total of 165,510 coins. The result is stated in an elaborate table,
                            showing on the data thus obtained the proportion of 100,000 sovereigns
                            and half-sovereigns belonging to each year; but the principal conclusion
                            for the present purpose is that „out of every 100,000 sovereigns now in
                            circulation, 18,671 sovereigns are found on an average to bear the dates
                            1863 and 1864.“ The proportion varies in different localities; but after
                            drawing up many averages, he had found this to be near the truth.
                            According to the plan of procedure this result brings us very near the
                            end. The proportion of the whole coinage of sovereigns to that part of
                            it bearing the date of 1863 and 1864, being as 100,000 is to 18,671, or
                            as 5.356 (5<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi>)
                            times greater, we have only to ascertain what the circulating coinage of
                            those years (1863 and 1864) is, and multiply by 5<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi>, to find out the total amount of
                            the circulation.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">This last step is easily performed. The coinage of
                            sovereigns of 1863–64 was £14,578,000, but of this amount £600,000 at
                            the date of the circulation were lying in bags as received from the mint
                            – had never passed into circulation at all. The quantity of 1863–64
                            sovereigns circulating cannot therefore exceed 14,578,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> minus 600,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, or
                            just about 14,000,000<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>; the whole circulation of
                            sovereigns cannot exceed 5<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> times 14,000,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>,
                            or in round numbers £75,000,000. A similar calculation for
                            half-sovereigns shows that 12,819 out of every 100,000 are of the
                            coinage of 1863–64, or about <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">8</hi> of the whole coinage. As the coinage of
                            those years amounted to £1,565,000, the total number of half-sovereigns

                            export of the 1863–64 coinage corresponded in amount at least to the
                            proportion of that coinage to the whole coinage; it may have been
                            greater, as exporters prefer the newest and heaviest coinage, but it
                            cannot well have been less. In other words as the sovereigns of 1863–64
                            form about <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> of
                            the sovereign currency, they must at least form <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> of the above exports. We have
                            thus to deduct l,750,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> from the 14 Mill. £
                            of 1863–64 coin which passed into circulation, giving 12,250,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> the figure which we must multiply by 5<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> to arrive at the

                        <p rend="justify">The second branch of the inquiry relates to the condition
                            of the coinage – the practical question being how large a portion of the
                            coin in circulation are under legal tender, and how much the deficiency
                            is. To obtain a conclusion on this point Jevons weighed singly, upon a
                            delicate chemical balance, 434 Sovereigns and 178 half Sovereigns drawn
                            from the ordinary circulation at Manchester. He finds the <hi rendition="#u">Average Annual Wear of the</hi>
                            <pb n="83"/>
                            <hi rendition="#u">Sovereign</hi> to be .043 grain (<hi rendition="#sup">43</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">100</hi>) or .00276 grammes. As the
                            coins when issued weigh 7.9871 grammes, and cease to be legal tender
                            when they fall below 7.9379 grammes (122·5 grains), about 18 years will
                            suffice to reduce a sovereign on the average below its legal currency.
                            Age and weight of every sovereign will of course not correspond, for
                            some are coined heavier than others and the wear is different, but the
                            average is true. „It would“, says Jevons, „be hard to name a subject in
                            which reasonings by average may be more safely trusted than the present,
                            because the coinage consists of an immense number of pieces which are
                            constantly circulating through every part of the country and in every
                            kind of business.“ Having thus settled the average annual loss and
                            knowing the average weight of issue, Jevons has the means of calculating
                            from the first table he prepared how many of the coins now in use are
                            under legal tender and what the deficiency in those coins is. As to what
                            are <hi rendition="#u">under</hi> legal tender the calculation simply is
                            that as a coin falls below legal tender <hi rendition="#u">in 18
                                years</hi> the <hi rendition="#u">proportion of sovereigns in
                                circulation of a greater age</hi> than 18 is equivalent to the
                            proportion of illegally light sovereigns. The proportion of coinage of a
                            greater age than 18 being 31.5 P. Ct., it follows <choice>

                            </choice> this is also the percentage of the light to the total coinage.
                            In 1840 and 1841, when there was a partial recoinage, the proportion of
                            light gold did not rise of 25 or 28 P. Ct. There is an extraordinary
                            difference of age between the sovereigns in the Bank of England and
                            those outside it. The Bank being rigorous in cancelling light gold,
                            light coin avoids it.</p>

                        <p rend="justify">The result is curiously illustrated by tables which Jevons
                            gives as to the age of the coin – showing that the coin is newer in the
                            manufacturing and mining districts, and that the proportion of old coin
                            increases as we pass in the agricultural districts. The motion of the
                            coin is mostly indiscriminate, but there are prevailing currents such as
                            those caused by the influx of tourists into Wales and North Scotland.
                                <hi rendition="#mMM">The main current however is produced by the
                                habit of dealers in cattle and farm produce to make payments in
                                gold, which is the cause of the influx of coin into agricultural
                                districts.</hi> The consequence of this is that as the imports of
                            those districts are likely to be paid for in draughts gold tends to
                            accumulate in them, and it becomes necessary from time to time for the
                            local banks to make remittances to London. But very naturally the banks
                            select and remit the heaviest coins so as to avoid the loss on light
                            gold which they are obliged to receive in the regular course of
                            business. Notwithstanding, this „sieving and picking“ which is
                            constantly going on, Jevons has unquestionable information that <hi rendition="#u">in the year ending 30. Sept. 1868</hi>, one large
                            banking establishment lost on its light gold no less a sum than £6,716,
                            in addition to „a large loss in interest on the stock we keep, so as to
                            avail ourselves of any opportunity of placing the coin in
                            circulation.“</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Assuming that on the average all the deficiency on coin
                            since 1850 is covered by the allowance for wear, it is found that the
                            deficiency on the earlier sovereigns amounts to 307<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> in 100,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, or nearly <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> P. Ct. This
                            would give a total deficiency to be made good of 200,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> The proportion of deficiency in
                            halfsovereigns is greater. <hi rendition="#u">The average life of a</hi>

                            but taking 10 years as a safer figure it is found that this gives a
                            proportion of 47 P. Ct. as light, or 5<hi rendition="#sup">3</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> millions out of 12 Mill. The actual amount
                            of the deficiency in coins which are not legal tender is 100,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> Altogether the recoinage necessary will be

                        <p rend="justify">This is not the statement of a progressive country.
                            Probably the increasing skill of smugglers keeps the revenue down and
                            hides the real progress made – the tariff likewise growing more and more
                            prohibitive; but there is also great depression, as the complaints about
                            ship building and other trades prove.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">American Industry suffers because of an irredeemable
                            currency, which causes fluctuations in prices and consequent uncertainty
                            in performing contracts. McCulloch wishes to get rid of this
                            irredeemable currency, suggesting last year the <hi rendition="#u">contraction</hi> of the currency till it equals gold in value. That
                            suggestion was scouted. His idea now is to make contracts to pay in
                            coin, as well as „in lawful money of the U. St.“ permissible. In
                            practice it is hoped this would lead to the abandonment of irredeemable
                            paper.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">The interest of the debt is out of all proportion
                            excessive when the position and resources of the State are considered.
                            It would be a great gain to pay less. But credit of U. St. bad, mainly
                            through fear of repudiation, especially through the fear that the
                            principal of certain debts will be paid off in depreciated currency.
                            McCulloch verlangt daher a declaration of the Legislature, that the
                            principal shall be paid in „that currency which is alone recognised as
                            money in the dealings of nation with nation.“ It is the height of folly
                            to go on paying a burdensome interest for 17 years for the sake of
                            paying off a smaller sum in principal at the end of that time.
                            Repudiation loans in the future.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Johnson, in his message, directs attention to the
                            circumstances under which high rates of interest were agreed to. He
                            dwells on the huge profits of the capitalist who holds obligations for
                            300 and 400 P. Ct. more than the U. St. received. He represents America
                            as paying tribute to the foreigner, and national debts as characteristic
                            of monarchies.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">Even McCulloch speaks quite frankly of the people of the
                            West being „more sensible of the burdens of Federal Taxation than are
                            those of the Eastern States“, because few bonds are held in the
                            former.</p>

                        <p rend="justify"> The recent declaration of the House of Representatives

                        <p rend="justify">„That all forms and degrees of repudiation of the national
                            indebtedness are odious to the American people, and that under no

                            creditor as full compensation a less amount of <hi rendition="#u">money</hi> than that which the Gvt. <hi rendition="#u">contracted

                            Birmingham Bankruptcy Court), having become bankrupt, applied to pass
                            her last examination and for an order of discharge. She was somewhat
                            sharply examined by her assignee, who, as her and her late husband’s
                            attorney, had become her creditor, as to her disposal of some ewes and
                            lambs, and some cows, which it appeared she had given to her children.

                            Her husband had died some time ago, and since his death she had been
                            struggling to maintain her family by the occupation of the farm. „We
                            were there 40 years”, she said, „and we did everything – buildings,
                            gates, and everything on the farm; for it was like an uninhabited place
                            when we went there; and we never got a farthing for all we had done. My
                            poor husband said on his dying bed: I am sorry for you. I have been
                            working all my lifetime for the Squire, not for you and my family“.
                            Those were his dying words.</p>
                        <p rend="justify">She said: „Only 6 years ago all the land wanted draining
                            and we had to do it all, except just putting the tiles in. Then my poor
                            husband lay ill 11 weeks, and we never had the least transactions of any
                            kind, and I had to sell my beasts and pay some debts directly after his
                            death. Then I had half a years’ rent and above 170<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> odd to pay. I was obliged to sell my stock and I paid all
                            that off. Then at the latter end of the year I had another rent to pay,
                            and then they sent me out of the farm without a farthing for all we had
                            done upon it. There was not anything in the world on it but what we
                            built ourselves – we improved the land as well as the building. We built
                            a lime-kiln, and we bought all the manure round that ever we could get…
                            . After the death of my husband it became time to sow turnips and oats.
                            The landlord said he would enter an action against me if I sowed oats,
                            and I did not do it. He said he would take the ploughed land to himself

                    <p rend="justify">The debts between different countries, when they approach this
                        time of settlement, are embodied, as far as possible, in bills of exchange;
                        this mode of adjustment being universally applied, so far as the
                        indebtedness of one country to others is covered by the liabilities of those
                        countries to itself. (24, 25) An exchange made between the drawer or seller
                        of the bill and the purchaser of the bill; the former ceding his claim on a
                        foreign debtor against payment on the spot, and the purchaser remitting the
                        bill to another foreigner to whom he is himself indebted. (25)</p>
                    <p rend="justify">The greater portion of bills will represent exports of
                        produce, bes. zwischen weit entfernten Ländern. The closer the countries,
                        the more diversified and complicated are the transactions represented by
                        bills of exchange. Between the continent and England there is a very large
                        proportion of bills which represent the expenditure of foreign residents,
                        drafts on their bankers at home, and encashments of dividends or other
                        sources of revenue. There will be found innumerable bills based on the sales
                        or purchases of stock, and large amounts which represent the transfer of
                        capital from one country to another by way of giving effect to a public loan
                        or a joint-stock undertaking. (26)</p>
                    <p rend="justify">Few foreign loans are negotiated which are not accompanied by
                        a certain issue of bills of exchange. Whenever the country which has secured

                        of remittances to cover it, bills may most conveniently be drawn upon the
                        lending country for the amount of the loan thus contracted; for they will at
                        once be eagerly purchased, in order to be remitted to the foreign creditors.
                        In the contrary case, where there is no balance requiring settlement, a loan

                        every country in the world, being in constant receipt of English
                        manufactures, is under the necessity of making remittances to pay for them,
                        either in bullion, in produce, or in bills. It may divert its produce to
                        other countries, but the bills drawn against such produce will be sure to
                        find their way to England. In other words, there will be a demand for bills
                        on London bankers, and English bills will be more saleable than any others.
                        There can be no exchange on any place to which remittances have not
                        constantly and regularly to be made. And vice versa, when remittances have
                        regularly to be made, an exchange is soon established, and the intervention
                        of a mutual centre is not required. F. i., England exports fabulous
                        quantities of Manchester goods to the East, and silver into the bargain,
                        receiving in exchange tea and silk. But the tea and silk which England
                        requires be less in value than the merchandise exported. How can the balance
                        be regulated? The Americans export very little to China, but require more
                        silk and tea from the Chinese than what they give them in goods.
                        Consequently, the Chinese have a surplus claim on New York. This they
                        transfer to their Engl. creditors, to whom they are indebted for the surplus
                        value of the goods imported from England over their own produce shipped to
                        England; in other words they remit to their English creditors the bills

                        connected with England, and thus A can pay B by assigning to him a claim
                        against England, which he himself has received in payment from C; or more

                        than she is at present, the New York Houses paid themselves for their
                        shipments of tobacco or other produce to Bremen, by drawing for Bremen
                        account on England, and Bremen would settle the transaction by buying up and
                        remitting to England the bills of the Holstein cattle-dealers or of the
                        butter exporters of the Low Countries. But now so many German manufactures
                        are sent to the States, that there are always buyers of bills drawn on
                        Bremen direct; or, more simply, the tobacco and cotton shipped to Germany is
                        paid for by German manufactures, and no further intervention is required.
                        What becomes then of the cattle and butter bills, which are thus <hi rendition="#u">set free</hi>? These are still collected in Bremen and
                        remitted to England, but against different transactions. No regular mutual
                        intercourse yet between Germany and Bombay. Bombay as yet takes very little
                        from Germany, the great bulks of her dealings being still with England.
                        Consequently, the Bombay merchants, finding few purchasers for bills on
                        Bremen, still draw on London for German account, when they ship cotton
                        direct to the continent: and a transaction takes place which in fact amounts
                        to this, that they direct their London creditors to obtain payment from
                        their German debtors. Accordingly these latter are still under the necessity
                        of buying up bills upon England, as constituting the most convenient
                        remittance by which they can effect those payments to Engl. merchants which
                        their Bombay creditors instructed them to make. … In these intermediate

                        year; and that, consequently, the seasons when the imports have to be paid
                        for will not coincide with the seasons when payment is exacted from foreign
                        countries for exports. Z. B. in a purely corngrowing country, the revenue
                        derived from foreign countries will come in at the conclusion of the
                        harvest, when the cargoes of corn begin to be despatched. There will then be
                        bills drawn against these shipments on the countries to which they are
                        directed. Meanwhile, however, the country in question has been importing
                        manufactures from its neighbours all the year round, and the importers have
                        been requiring bills on foreign countries, in order to make remittances,
                        long before the cornbills could be drawn and become available. (38) If no
                        other device could be found, the importers would, before the harvest <pb n="93"/> time, be obliged to remit gold abroad in payment of their
                        purchases; and afterwards the exporters, not being able to sell all their
                        bills, which the importers would now no longer want, would have to receive
                        back the equivalent of their exports in remittances of gold from abroad.

                        bills representing bona fide transactions can be bought, and subsequently
                        square the liability which they have incurred towards the acceptors of their
                        bills drawn in blank, by buying up and remitting the export bills as soon as
                        the goods have been shipped and are made available for drafts. Thus the
                        importers are able to procure bills from such banking houses at a time when
                        otherwise they could buy no bills at all, and the exporters sell to the same
                        bankers later on, at a time when otherwise they would find no purchasers,
                        the importations having been previously paid for. (39)</p>

                        actually despatched. Thus they are enabled to sell the bills at a time when
                        there is demand and when a premium is likely to be paid by the importing
                        branch of the community, instead of waiting for a time when the bulk of the
                        exports are despatched, and when, consequently, from the number of those who
                        have to draw bills, they would have to accept a lower price. (40) Great
                        complaints have been made in the Court of Bankruptcy etc of the system of

                        for the bill and the cost of the specie remittance were absolutely equal, it
                        would still be more convenient to send the bill. Beyond this point the

                        insurance. The more the supply of bills diminished, the more the premium
                        would rise, till the sellers might realise almost 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>$ profit. At this point the premium
                        clearly so high, that it would be indifferent to remitters whether they
                        bought bills or sent gold, and some would despatch gold and others buy the
                        bills, the surplus excess required to be remitted being in the mean time
                        gradually lessened by this despatch of gold. The exporters being less
                        pressed for their bills, soon had the opportunity of feeling the change in
                        the situation, and might content themselves with a smaller premium in order
                        to secure some profit before the demand was entirely satisfied. Hence a fall

                        apprehension of the civil war in the U. St., fluctuations in the American
                        rates of exchange much below the specie point. The balance of trade was much
                        in favour of America. Very considerable exports of grain and flour, coupled
                        with a reduction of imports, in consequence of political apprehensions.
                        Hence natural that exchanges should fall to specie point. But they fell much
                        below it. Reason: the peculiarly urgent necessity der exporters, of selling
                        their bills immediately, at any sacrifice. It was a question of time. Three
                        or 4 P. Ct. were sacrificed to secure the proceeds of the bills on England
                        at once, instead of waiting for the arrival of gold. The exporter either
                        might sell his bills at what they would fetch, or send them himself to
                        Europe, with instructions to his correspondent to encash them, and remit the
                        amount in bullion. The latter course was cheaper, but as he required funds
                        immediately (or, under the influence of panic, believed that he would so
                        require them) he adopted the former. (<supplied cert="high">49,</supplied>

                    <p rend="justify">In ordinary times, capitalists would have competed with each
                        other in buying up the drafts of urgent sellers. They would then have
                        remitted <pb n="95"/> them to Europe on their own account, so as to secure
                        the profit between the low price paid for the bills and their specie value.
                        They would have bought at a heavy discount, in order subsequently to realise
                        at least the specie value. But, at a time of commercial panic, such
                        capitalists are seldom willing to launch out into a speculation which
                        deprives them, during the weeks which must elapse before the gold arrives,
                        of the command over their funds. Interest may rise during the interval –
                        they may anticipate. (50) Z. B. They expected to gain 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> P. Ct. net on the exchange. In their
                        calculation the interest taken into account they would lose from the time
                        when they paid the drawer for his bill up to the moment when the returns in
                        gold arrive. The interval sei a month, interest calculated on it at 6%
                        p. a., or <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> P. Ct. for
                        the month. If it rise suddenly to 24 P. Ct. p. a., they would have to borrow
                        money at the rate of 2% for the month, in order to replace that portion of
                        their capital which is travelling to Europe and back; also 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>% more than they
                        calculated. Thus they would gain nothing on their exchange operation. Also
                        stringent moneymarket acts materially upon the exchanges, inducing sellers
                        to force sales, and creating a reluctance on the part of purchasers to buy
                        unless absolutely compelled to remit. This cause will not come forcibly into
                        operation, when the international transactions are in a state of
                        equilibrium; for there will be then as many purchasers on compulsion as
                        there are sellers, and the dearness of money may only operate so far as to
                        induce purchasers to defer their remittances to the last moment, whereas
                        sellers would wish that they should be hastened. Its full force will be felt
                        at a time when the country where money is supposed to be dear, or where
                        panic exists, has exported more than it has imported, and when it is
                        consequently certain that gold will finally have to be ordered, <hi rendition="#u">while no individual is himself willing to wait for its

                        result would be witnessed in 1861. In 1857 the Americans had incurred
                        enormous debts to Europe; in <seg type="comment"><orig>1861</orig><note xml:id="ns1p_d2g_wjb">Bei Goschen Druckfehler: 1863</note></seg>
                        Europe had incurred enormous debts to her. On the former occasion the export
                        of specie to the States was unnatural and artificial. In latter case the
                        export of bullion was unavoidable. It was only hurried, because the American
                        creditor, finding himself in the midst of a most dangerous political crisis,
                        became suddenly urgent to receive all that was due to him, and to forestall,
                        rather than to delay, the settlement of his claim. He drew his bills and
                        forced them on the market with the eagerness of panic. Few buyers were to be
                        found requiring them as remittances in discharge of European liabilities;
                        for, trade had been curtailed, no new orders had been given, and, before the
                        crisis commenced, the unusual prosperity of the Western States, in
                        consequence of vast crops of grain, had made it possible for remittances
                        against previous transactions to be sent earlier than usual. Thus, the bills
                        were bought up in New York, not by such as had liabilities to discharge, but
                        by such as were willing to advance the value of the bills till their
                        equivalent in gold could be procured from England. This was the office of
                        the New York banks, and by far the greater quantity of the bullion shipments
                        consisted in what may be called the anticipated proceeds of these bills.
                        Without the influence of panic, a high rate of interest on this side might
                        have delayed the export of the proceeds, at least till the maturity of the
                        bills. If these proceeds had remained longer on this side, they would either
                        have constituted a loan to the banker to whom they were remitted, or have
                        been invested in some kind of merchandise, and returned in that form rather
                        than in that of gold. (94–96)</p>

                        who (1861), in the first instance suffered most from the situation, in so
                        far as the expense of the costly transmission of specie, with all the losses
                        attached to it, would fall upon them. The English debtors may be argued not
                        to have suffered any loss, because to them it was immaterial how they paid
                        their bills at maturity – whether by handing their amount over to their
                        neighbours, to whom the Americans would, in normal times, have remitted
                        bills upon them; or by shipping it in gold by order and for account of their
                        American creditors. But … <hi rendition="#u">the charge on the exporter

                        To the extent the interests of the exporter become identical with those of
                        the foreign country. For, that which adds to the cost of the article which
                        he exports, must be borne either by him or by the consumer of his produce;
                        and it is their joint interest that no such addition should be made. The
                        cost of the transmission of bullion is an addition of this nature; and
                        therefore it is contrary to the interest of the exporter, and the country to
                        which he exports, that such an expense should have to be incurred. (98,

                        but causes an additional charge to the export trade. However, the extra
                        charge upon this export trade having ultimately, on the above supposition,
                        to be paid by foreign countries, it may be maintained that the state of the
                        exchanges indicated is, in a certain sense, favourable to the country in

                    <p rend="justify">Assume (what is partially true) that each country <hi rendition="#u">fetches</hi> from the other what it requires; in other

                        States, not for account of American sellers, but of English buyers who have
                        given their orders. If the article is bought by a foreign buyer in the place
                        of its production, any sudden extra charge upon exportation must be borne by
                        him. Thus a sudden fall in the exchanges, which makes his bill upon his
                        London house less valuable, or causes the whole cost of the transmission of
                        bullion from England to pay for his purchases to fall upon him, becomes
                        unfavourable to the country to which he belongs, and for which he is buying,
                        and not to that from which he is buying. Conversely, the Americans who give
                        orders to Engl. manufacturers are able, during the same period of low
                        exchanges, to buy up bills on England which will pay for their goods, at a
                        cheaper rate than usual, and are able to save the expense of the
                        transmission of bullion, which, during normal times, generally falls on a

                        payable 3 months after date is bought by a banker at a price which is equal
                        to a bill payable on demand less 3 months’ interest, and this interest will
                        not be that of the country where the bill is drawn, but that of the place
                        where the bill is payable: for the purchaser will have to discount the bill
                        in the foreign country at the rate there ruling, before he can make it
                        equally available with a draft on demand; and the drawer can suffer this
                        deduction from the price of the bill at the same rate without loss, as,
                        giving the foreign acceptor 3 months’ grace before payment, he will receive
                        from him the same amount of interest until the debt is discharged by the
                        actual payment of the bill, as he loses in the price of the bill itself.
                        Accordingly, when foreign bills are bought as an investment, it is with the
                        view of earning the higher rate of a foreign country, in the place of the
                        lower rate ruling at home. … this tendency always in operation when the rate
                        of interest is peculiarly high in any country, the creditor of which is
                        unimpeached. (<supplied cert="high">135,</supplied> 136, 137) As a matter of
                        fact, the interest which can be secured by the speculative purchasers of
                        bills, generally lies between the rate of the country where the bill is
                        purchased, and the rate of that on which it is drawn, as competition enables
                        the seller to secure a portion of this species of profit. If the rate in
                        Germany is 3 P. Ct., and in England 5%, those who have 3 months’ bills on
                        England will not be obliged to submit to a discount of 5% … Many will be
                        found, who, in order themselves to make 1% more than the highest rate which
                        they can secure at home, will not claim to deduct more than 4% from the
                        price which they would pay for a bill on demand, instead of 5%. … These

                    <p rend="justify">At any moment there is in the hands of bankers and exchange
                        dealers a large amount of bills on various countries, held partly for

                        extent, solely for the sake of the interest which is to be made on them.
                        Bills on England, owing to the high rate of interest which they often bear,
                        as compared with continental rates, are a favourite investment abroad. In
                        Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg etc, the bills on England held by the
                        bankers and joint stock Cos. often amount to many millions £. St.; and a
                        very large sum remains in their hands for several months – in fact, from the
                        time when the bills are drawn to the time when they are due … If at any time
                        the rate of interest here falls below that which rules on the Continent, it
                        is inevitable that the whole mass of those bills will be at once sent to
                        London, <pb n="107"/> and be discounted there at the cheaper rate, so that
                        the proceeds may be remitted in gold to the Continent to be invested there
                        in local securities at the supposed higher rate. On the other hand, so long
                        as the discount in London is higher than abroad, so long the foreign bankers
                        will be induced to hold their bills till they become due. The debt, embodied

                        will, within certain limits, depend upon the rate of interest. If it be
                        high, the bills will be allowed to run off abroad, and the gold will not be
                        exported till the last moment; umgekehrt im andren Fall. (138, 139)</p>
                    <p rend="justify">Accordingly, if, f. i., specie is exported from England to
                        America, an advance in the rate of discount, is an inducement to foreign
                        capitalists to hold back their bills upon England to the last moment, as
                        well as to make remittances hither to invest the proceeds at the high rate:
                        both circumstances cause a demand for these bills abroad, and their price
                        must rise. At the same time, a proportionate fall in the price of foreign
                        bills will occur. For, a convenient mode of placing funds in England being
                        to instruct Engl. firms to draw on foreign bankers, these bills are likely
                        to be pressed on the market; whereas, owing to the assumed desire rather to
                        leave capital in England than to call it in, there will be few purchasers
                        for them, and their price must decline. The rise of bills on England abroad
                        is always identical with the fall of the prices of foreign bills in England;
                        for there are 2 ways of settling every international transaction: either the
                        creditor draws a bill on the debtor, or the debtor remits a bill to the
                        creditor; and, accordingly, the same circumstances which make it difficult
                        to the creditor to sell his bill to advantage, will make it difficult for
                        the debtor to purchase the necessary remittances to advantage. When bills on
                        England decrease in value abroad, bills on the continent increase in value
                        on the London exchange; and when, as in the case where a high rate of
                        interest is setting the current of capital towards England, there is a great
                        demand, at high prices, for bills upon London, there is a corresponding
                        absence of demand and low prices in England for bills on foreign cities.
