                            memorialists, war das in New York before the civil war. Every bank could
                            there issue notes, but every bank was obliged to deposit „security“; but
                            that system did not absolve the banks from the necessity of keeping a
                            stock of gold and silver, and it did not produce a low rate of interest.
                            The normal rate was often very high – higher than the present rate
                            complained of. The banks, as soon as they saw their reserve of bullion
                            getting low, raised the rate of interest, and kept that rate high till
                            the stock was replenished.</p>
                            <p>If the banks keep the rate of interest too low for a time, they make
                                it too high afterwards.</p>

                            minimum, the money market will be most delicate. And as long as bankers,
                            one or many, are guided by their own interest, it will be kept at that
                            minimum. </p>

                            question: <hi rendition="#u">What is a product?</hi> The law decided
                            that a thing was produced when it was <hi rendition="#u">„made“</hi>. Of
                            course when it is completed, and the only test of its completion is its

                            consumer gets is the aggregate of a 100 previous sellings and makings.
                            The law could make no distinction between articles sold to a <hi rendition="#u">manufacturer</hi> and a <hi rendition="#u">consumer</hi>. It would have been baffled by wholesale evasion. It
                            taxed all „makings“ 6%. The Commission describes the curious result:
                            „Under the operation of this law the Gvt. now levies and collects from 8
                            to 15%, in some instances 20%, on almost every finished industrial
                            product. … A good illustration … is presented in the <hi rendition="#u">manufacture of umbrellas and parasols</hi>, as carried on in the
                            cities of <hi rendition="#u">New York and Philadelphia</hi>. It was
                            formerly the practice of umbrella-makers to manufacture the main
                            constituents of their product as <hi rendition="#u">one business</hi>;
                            but now the business of an umbrella-maker is rather to <hi rendition="#u">assemble the various constituents</hi> of an umbrella
                            or parasol, which <hi rendition="#u">are made separately</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">in different parts of the country</hi>. Thus, f. e.,
                            the <hi rendition="#u">sticks</hi>, when of <hi rendition="#u">wood</hi>, are made in Philadelphia and in Connecticut; part of <hi rendition="#u">native</hi> and part of <hi rendition="#u">foreign
                                wood</hi>, on which last a duty may have been paid. If the
                            supporting <hi rendition="#u">rod</hi> is of <hi rendition="#u">iron</hi> or of <hi rendition="#u">steel</hi>, it is the product of
                            still another establishment. In like manner the <hi rendition="#u">handles</hi> of <hi rendition="#u">carved wood</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">bone</hi> or <hi rendition="#u">ivory</hi>; the <hi rendition="#u">brass runners</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">tips</hi>,
                            the <hi rendition="#u">elastic band</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">rubber</hi>, of which the band is composed, the <hi rendition="#u">silk tassels</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">buttons</hi>, and the <hi rendition="#u">cover of silk</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">gingham</hi>
                            or <hi rendition="#u">alpaca</hi>, are all <hi rendition="#u">distinct
                                products</hi> of manufacture, and each of these constituents, if of
                            domestic manufacture, pays a tax when sold of 6% <hi rendition="#u">ad
                                valorem</hi>, or its equivalent. The umbrella manufacturer now <hi rendition="#u">aggregates</hi> all these constituent parts,
                            previously taxed, into a finished product, and then pays 6% on the
                            whole. It is, therefore, evident that under the existing excise system,
                            all the parts of the umbrella are taxed <hi rendition="#u">at least
                                twice</hi>, and, in some cases, <hi rendition="#u">three times</hi>,
                            thus adding from 12 to 15% on the umbrella direct; while we may feel
                            certain, moreover, that each separate manufacturer makes the payment of
                            the 6% tax on his special product an occasion for adding from 1 to 3%
                            additional to its cost price, in some instances over 6%.“</p>
                            <p>„Again, in the case of books, pamphlets etc, it is claimed that,
                            including licenses and income tax, the finished book and its constituent
                            materials pay from <hi rendition="#u">12 to 15 distinct taxes</hi>
                            before reaching the reader. Every <hi rendition="#u">separate item that
                                enters into the book</hi> – <hi rendition="#u">paper, cloth, boards,

                            <pb n="20"/> and <hi rendition="#u">type material</hi> – pays from 3 to
                            6% in the first instance, and then 5% on the whole combined; and this
                            not upon the <hi rendition="#u">cost</hi> of the manufactured article,
                            but upon the <hi rendition="#u">price</hi> at which it is sold.“</p>
                            <p>The effect of this tax, in appearance so equitable and simple, has
                                been to impose a burden <hi rendition="#u">differing</hi> almost in
                                every instance upon the different industries of the country.</p>
                            <p>Nor is this all. <hi rendition="#u">The tax of 6% on domestic
                                products</hi> has led to the oddest results when compared with <hi rendition="#u">the tariff on imports</hi>. That tariff is
                            necessarily a tariff on consumable articles: not on the bits and
                            components of such articles. Umbrellas or books come by ship as wholes,
                            and must be taxed as wholes. How then is an <hi rendition="#u">Excise-duty</hi> to be made equal to the <hi rendition="#u">Customhouse system</hi>, and no <hi rendition="#u">more than equal

                            be added that, during the past 6 months imported umbrellas have been
                            sold at auction in New York and Boston, with the <hi rendition="#u">original cost, duty, freight and charges paid in gold, for a less

                            their capital and skill to Europe. In a communication submitted to the

                            Act.―</head>
                        <p><hi rendition="#mPrint">The last Act of the late session was to provide
                                better dwellings for artizans and labourers. The preamble states
                                that it is expedient to make provision for taking down or improving
                                dwellings occupied by working men and their families which are unfit
                                for human habitation, and for the building and maintenance of better
                                dwellings for such persons. The Act is to apply to the metropolitan
                                and other districts of the United Kingdom as set forth in the
                                schedule. The mode of procedure under this statute is very simple.
                                It provides for the appointment of officers where necessary, and if
                                in any place to which the Act applies the officer of health finds
                                that any premises therein are in a condition or state dangerous to
                                health so as to be unfit for human habitation he is to report the
                                same, and notice forthwith is to be taken to remove or to improve
                                the same. Action is to be taken by local authorities on the report
                                of surveyors against the owners to make them comply with the
                                directions, subject to an appeal to the Quarter Sessions. On four or
                                more householders living in or near to any street representing in
                                writing to the officer of health that any premises in or near that
                                street are in a condition or state dangerous to health he is to
                                inspect them and report, but the absence of any such representation
                                is not to excuse him from inspecting any premises and reporting
                                thereon. In the event of the local authority declining or neglecting
                                for the space of three months after receiving such report to take
                                any proceedings to put the Act in force, the householders who signed
                                the representation may address a memorial to the Secretary of State,
                                and he may direct the local authority to proceed under the Act. On
                                the owner of premises being required to execute the works, and in
                                his default, the local authority may either order the premises to be
                                shut up or to be demolished, or may themselves <pb n="22"/>do the
                                work. Where the local authorities execute the works they may apply
                                to the Quarter Sessions for an order charging on the premises the
                                amount of all costs and expenses in and about the execution of the
                                works, and the Quarter Sessions, when satisfied of the amount so
                                expended, is to make an order charging the property with the amount
                                and 4 per cent. interest which charge is to have priority over all
                                other charges, and to be deemed a mortgage. If the requirements of
                                the order involve the total demolition and not the improvement of
                                the premises, the owner is within three months after service of the
                                order to remove the same, and if he fails then the local authority
                                is to execute the order and pay him any balance that may remain
                                after the expenses from the sale of the materials. Instead of
                                effecting the improvements required by the local authority, the
                                owner may take down the premises. Where an owner executes the work
                                required by a local authority he is to have an annuity as
                                compensation for the expenditure incurred by him in the shape of a
                                charging order. The annuity is to be £6 for every £100, and to be
                                payable for 30 years. Every charging order on premises in Middlesex
                                and Yorkshire is to be recorded in the Registry-office. With the
                                view of a general adoption of the Act–and there are many places
                                where the working classes “most do congregate”―the Public Loan
                                Commissioner may make advances, and the local authorities may borrow
                                money for the purposes mentioned. Many public improvements are being
                                carried out and contiguous to the same are wretched dwellings; they
                                could be improved or demolished, and the principle involved in the
                                preamble that they were unfit for working men and their families as
                                “human habitations” could be easily established.―<hi rendition="#u">Times</hi>.</hi>

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">duty on Tea</hi> formed a principal item in the Russian

            <p>Mr. Mitchell estimates the total importation of manufactured articles into Russia in
                            1864 at 2,930,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> paying a duty of 645,333<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, about 22% on the Russian valuation, but at
                            least 50% <hi rendition="#u">ad valorem.</hi> This throws the greater
                            part of the import trade into the hands of the smuggler; and the
                            operations of the latter are on a proportionate scale. <hi rendition="#u">Differential duties in favour of importation by the
                                land frontier</hi> also favour smuggling. Houses are established for
                            the systematic smuggling of goods into Russia at a premium of 35%; and
                            under this system British trade m. Russia, except as regards bulky
                            articles, such as iron, machinery and coals, is rapidly dwindling into a
                            contraband trade; whilst the trade over the frontier has facilitated the
                            introduction of imitations of English goods with fraudulent trades
                            marks. The interests of the Russ<ex>ian</ex> ports and Russ<ex>ian</ex>
                            mercantile marine are also sacrificed by these differential duties, and
                            the rate of freights for Russ<ex>ian</ex> exportations is materially
                            increased.</p>
            <p>As the result, Mr. Mitchell calculates that comparing 1859 with 1863, our trade with
                            Russia has decreased 11%.</p>

                                to look to the return of his principal at a specified moment; the

                                their market value in fact or in prospect, and their consequent
                                negotiability. The discounter may take money on deposit for short
                                periods with safety; the finance Co. can only borrow for long
                                periods with any degree of safety.</p>

                                upon railways, and we have seen, too, the railways themselves
                                started into existence without shares or any market shape. Now we
                                begin to see that <hi rendition="#u">the new money lenders</hi> have
                                been <hi rendition="#u">their chief support</hi>, and that the high
                                terms bid by railway contractors have not only induced the new
                                Discount and Finance Cos to incur injudicious risks, but have
                                contributed to no small extent to the <hi rendition="#u">high value
                                    of money in this country, for the last 2 years</hi>.</p>
            <p>A far as the <hi rendition="#u">official figures</hi> go, there is nothing very
                                alarming in the position of our new Discount and Finance Cos.</p>

            <p>„The <hi rendition="#u">Un. States Government</hi> stands in America in the same
                            monetary position (vis-à-vis d<ex>en</ex> banks) in which the B. o. E.
                            stood here. (vis-à-vis d<ex>en</ex> country banks während d<ex>er</ex>

                            in round numbers, for the present much depreciated as compared with
                            gold. They are „legal tender“. If an Americ<ex>an</ex> bank has enough
                            of these notes, it will pay its way.</p>
            <p>Before the civil war <hi rendition="#u">no national system.</hi> Each state had <hi rendition="#u">its own banking law</hi>. Annoyance of a currency so
                            multifarious in a country where locomotion so constant and so distant. A
                            Chicago note was at a discount at Washington, and a Delaware note was
                            difficult to pass at Chicago. <hi rendition="#u">„Exchange“</hi>
                            dealings between the different states of the Union complex by the
                            difference of currency. <hi rendition="#u">Chase</hi> provided a
                            national uniform currency to replace the various States currencies.</p>
            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">Act of Congress</hi>, to this purpose, interferes <hi rendition="#u">not only with the issue of currency</hi>, but with
                            the <hi rendition="#u">trade of banking</hi> (d. h. securities for the
                                <hi rendition="#u">deposits</hi>, not only for the <hi rendition="#u">notes)</hi>. The Act permits no bank to be organised
                            „with a less capital than 150,000 dollars, nor in a city whose
                            population exceeds 50,000 persons with a less capital than 200,000
                            dollars“; though with the permission of the Secret<ex>ary</ex> of the
                            Treasury, a bank with a capital of <hi rendition="#u">no less than
                                50,000 dollars</hi> may be „organised in any place of which the
                            population does not exceed 6,000 inhabitants.“ In the principal cities
                            of the Union each bank must keep <hi rendition="#u">in lawful money 25%
                                of its circulation and deposits</hi>, and banks in less important
                            places <hi rendition="#u">15%;</hi> and every bank is bound to carry <hi rendition="#u"><hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">10</hi> of its profits</hi> to the reserve fund before
                            declaring a dividend, till <hi rendition="#u">that fund amounts to 20%
                                of its capital stock</hi> etc. The <hi rendition="#u">aggregate
                                circulation</hi> is limited to <hi rendition="#u">60 Mill. <hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> St.</hi>, and is <hi rendition="#u">divided amongst the banks</hi> according to the following singular
                            clause: „The amount of such circulating notes to be furnished to each
                            association shall be in proportion to its paid-up capital, as follows,
                            and no more: To each association whose capital shall not exceed 500,000
                            dollars, <hi rendition="#u">90% of such capital</hi>; to each
                            association whose capital exceeds 500,000 dollars, but does not exceed
                            1 mill. dollars, 80% of such capital; to each association whose capital
                            exceeds 1,000,000 dollars, but does not exceed 3 mill. dollars, 75% of
                            such capital; to each association whose capital exceeds 3 millions
                            dollars, 60% of such capital. And that <hi rendition="#u">150,000,000
                                dollars of the entire amount of circulating notes</hi> authorised to
                            be issued shall be apportioned to associations in the States, in the
                            district of Columbia, and in the Territories, according to
                            representative population, and the remainder shall be apportioned by the
                                Secr<ex>etary</ex> of the Treasury among associations formed in the
                            several States, in the district of Columbia, and in the Territory,
                            having due regard to the existing banking capital, resource, and
                            business of such State, district, and territory.“ The whole <pb n="27"/>
                            circulation is secured by the <hi rendition="#u">deposit of U. St.
                                bonds</hi> with 10% margin. This deposit of U. St. bonds was of
                            course, for the Finance minister, the primary point of the Act.
                            Mr. Chase was sorely in want of money. The existing bank circulation was
                            secured <hi rendition="#u">by state bonds</hi>; and it was of the first
                            importance to him to replace it by a currency secured by <hi rendition="#u">Federal bonds</hi>. He thus got a loan for the
                            national Exchequer out of funds before used by the State exchequers. At
                            any other time such a proposal would have excited the old controversy of
                            State right versus Federal right, and would most likely have been lost.
                            In the civil war – Mr. Chase passed his Act.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#mMM">Such an interference of Gvt. with country banking, or half such
                    an interference, would have been <hi rendition="#u">impossible</hi> in
                        England, but in <hi rendition="#u">a democratic country the
                        inhabitants do not look on the Gvt. as something apart from themselves</hi>
                    as we do, and do not feel humiliated by its interference; it is only <hi rendition="#u">themselves in another form</hi> enforcing what they think
                    right, and so they do not mind it.</hi></p>
            <p>Chase coaxed the existing banks. He offered them tempting terms to become, instead of
                            State banks under the old system, national banks under the new system.
                            And all but an insignificant fraction have become so. „In about 2<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> years“, boasts
                                Mr. M<hi rendition="#sup">c</hi>Culloch (<hi rendition="#u">finance
                                minister</hi> under Johnson), „from the organisation of the first
                            national bank, the whole system of banking under State laws has been
                            superseded, and the people of the Un. St. have been provided with a
                            circulation bearing upon it the seal of the Treasury department as a
                            guaranty of its solvency.“</p>
            <p>With the bold completeness which is its characteristic, the American gvt <hi rendition="#u">compels the publication</hi> of the most
                                elaborate accounts by every bank in the Union, and the Comptroller

                                    sind die Goldfunde in Australien seit 1851.</note></seg> which
                            came to our relief. But for them, we should not have been able to do
                            what we have done. There has been a substitution of Australian gold, new
                            or native gold, in place of the specie which we have sent to China or to
                            India, and which will be long before it returns, if it ever does return.
                            … There was a moment when I trembled for a crisis in Germany, because
                            silver had<pb n="31"/> disappeared: so much had been bought to send to
                            China and India; it had become so scarce at Hamburg, Frankfurt, and in
                            many other towns of Germany, where silver is the only circulating
                            medium, as in China and India, that we knew not what to do. Silver was
                            for a time at from 30 to 40f. premium per mille.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">President</hi>: Do you not think that the corrective of foreign
                            investments, loans, railways etc. is to be found in <hi rendition="#u">commercial operations themselves,</hi> and that, f. i., a nation
                            which borrows in the French market 300 or 400 millions, does not
                            withdraw them entirely, but employs a part to pay for goods paid
                            there?</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">J. Rothschild:</hi> Yes. <hi rendition="#sup">7</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">8</hi> or <hi rendition="#sup">15</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">16</hi> are employed in buying goods – locomotives
                            f. i., it is impossible to say how many we send abroad. I speak from
                            experience.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Michel Chevalier</hi>: If at a given moment there is a tendency
                among traders to export gold and silver, why should the Bank oppose it by any
                measures whatever? It does not trouble the export of wheat and wine, why should it
                trouble the export of gold?</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">J. Rothschild</hi>. Everybody has the right to defend himself, and
                            if the Bank finds that too much gold and silver is being exported, and
                            may consequently fear that in case the reimbursement of its notes should
                            be demanded, it could not make it, – it is its duty to say: I will
                            reduce my discount … so as to be in a situation to re-imburse my notes.
                            … The raising of interest makes the <hi rendition="#u">rarity of
                                money</hi>. Leave the interest of money at its ordinary rate, at a
                            moderate rate, nobody is disquieted, nobody takes precautions; whereas
                            the raising of interest always causes something unpleasant to be feared.
                            I, f. e., am seated at my desk; I receive a letter from Alexandria,
                            „Send me a million in 5f. pieces.“ The discount is at 4%, I see no
                            danger. I can send the money. But if the discount of the Bank be raised,
                            I say to myself: „I must take precautions“, and I do not send the money.
                            Knowing that I shall have payments to make at such and such an epoch,
                            and not knowing that money will not be still rarer at that moment, I
                            keep my funds, and I renounce a profit of 3 or 4%, rather than send my
                            money.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">M. Chevalier:</hi> But if the sum be due, you cannot avoid paying
                it; even if the discount should be 12 or 15%, the money must be sent.</p>

            <p>These undertakings being a heavy loss, that loss must fall somewhere, and a good deal
                                of it is now falling on the lenders in Lombardstreet. The <hi rendition="#u">year 1864</hi> was remarkable for several things,
                                and one of the most characteristic was the invention of a new verb.
                                    <hi rendition="#u">„Finance“</hi> used to be a substantive only
                                in English, but it then became a verb also … Generally sound and
                                cautious people (in money matters) like to <hi rendition="#u">nibble</hi> a <hi rendition="#u">little</hi> at questionable

                                class is sure to be left with the bad security. The clever, quick
                                people who <hi rendition="#u">concoct the delusions</hi> have a much

                            sick of diseases, more or less acute, and requiring more or less active
                            medical care, are crowded into the workhouse hospitals by order of the
                            parish doctor and the parish relieving officer, who rid themselves of
                            the trouble and the responsibility of attending to such cases by
                            combining to get them into the workhouse. Of these cases, there are now
                            over 6000 in the 41 London workhouses, giving about 150 really sick
                            persons to each; in addition to this there are no less than 10,500 of
                            the class properly called infirm, aged and feeble persons needing more
                            than ordinary pauper care, of whom at least <hi rendition="#u">half</hi>
                            want medical care as well as additional comfort, and 1,800 imbeciles or
                            idiots. So that the poor who are properly infirm poor are crowded out of
                            their proper accommodation by no less than 7,800 persons who do not
                            really belong to workhouses at all, 6000 of whom should be in ordinary,
                            well conducted hospitals, and 1800 of whom ought to be in asylums for
                            the imbecile, or the insane. Daher the most terrible misery not only to
                            the wretched patients themselves, but to the scarcely less wretched
                            poor. Lord Carnarvon (in public meeting über dieses theme) stated that
                            in one workhouse hospital, with 300 patients, the physician, who is
                            never paid more than £150 a year, has at most 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> minute with each patient, for he
                            cannot give more <hi rendition="#u">than 3 hours</hi> to the hospital if
                            he is to support his family. The same overcrowding makes the <hi rendition="#u">nursing</hi> disgraceful in the extreme. The Boards
                            of Guardians do not like to increase the rates. Hence they do their very
                            best to keep down the expenses of these miserable hospitals. Old crones
                            who are too infirm themselves for activity, too ignorant for intelligent
                            nursing, and too habituated to misery and dirt to see the evil of
                            inflicting misery and dirt upon others, are nominally appointed nurses,
                            by which they gain some trifling addition to their allowances and the
                            power of making the patients even more wretched than they would be
                            without any nurse at all. These creatures are often drinkers occupied
                            only in devices to get a little more spirit for their own allowance, and
                            their mode of dealing with the sick is of course summary in the extreme.
                            One nurse avowed that instead that of attending to the doctor’s orders,
                            she gave the medicine 2 or 3 times a day to those who seemed very ill,
                            or only 2 or once, as they seemed to get better.

                            medicines for 3 days to a patient very ill with gangrene, because the
                            said patient’s mouth had been sore. Nor is even this the worst. One<pb n="33"/> workhouse lets the premises outside to a carpet-beating Co.
                            for 600£ a year, and the unfortunate patients get their lungs filled
                            with dust and their ears with noise. Other workhouses leave their
                            patients in the most filthy condition imaginable. A guardian of <hi rendition="#u">St. Giles</hi>’ workhouse said that none of these
                            statements were true of his workhouse hospital … But the public have not

                                would suffice to prevent the export of gold, <hi rendition="#u">if
                                    the exchange were unfavourable to exportation</hi> for the Bank
                                to negotiate paper on London … I know this objection: „The Bank of

                                negotiate it at the same time as you do. But the mechanism of
                                exchanges is very simple. Paper on Paris cannot be demanded and
                                rising at London, at the same time that paper on London is demanded
                                and rising at Paris. It is the countrary which takes place; and is
                                the forced consequence of this change of the debit or credit
                                balance. Paper on London rises at Paris, when paper on Paris falls

            <p>On Oct. 5 (1865) the B. o. F. raised their rate suddenly, because they learned, by
                                telegraph, that the B. o. E. had done so. … I only know 2 banks in

                                They have each, independently of their mutual dependence, a
                                speciality. England, by her old connection with all the world, is
                                the market in which all the gold and silver of the New World and of
                                Australia arrive … This monopoly is assured to England by her
                                innumerable steam vessels. A steamship now leaves New York every day
                                    f<ex>ür</ex> England. In 1822, at Bordeaux, letters were only
                                received 2 a week from Paris, and Bayonne only got letters 2 a week
                                from Bordeaux. But now every day letters are received at London from
                                New York. It is at London that all the precious metals arrive.
                                … They are in great part spread over the Continent, and are
                                centralised at Paris. It is at Paris that the great trade in the
                                precious metals is carried on. Paris is also the principal exchange
                                market, and that in which is concentrated all the bills of exchange
                                drawn on England. Consequently, generally speaking, the metals
                                destined to pay in Europe the transactions not settled by bills of
                                exchange, return to Paris.</p>

                                    London are from 25.10 to 25.12<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>, whilst it is only possible to <hi rendition="#u">export</hi> at 25.37<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> or 25.40 on account of

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">American dollar sold at par</hi> is 5f. 16c. The expenses are

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">gold napoleon</hi> is worth in Ejypt 77<hi rendition="#sup">6</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">40</hi> piastres; which, with
                                    the cost of carriage, puts the rate at nearly 5.27 per Spanish
                                    piaster. (Sp<ex>anish</ex> piaster = 5f. 17c.) To <hi rendition="#u">export gold coin from France</hi> to Ejypt,
                                    the rate must be superior to that price; to import <hi rendition="#u">into France</hi> it must be below 5.23.</p>
            <p><pb n="36"/> All these calculations are made in estimating gold at par. If these were
                                    a premium, the parity would be changed.</p>
            <p>If now we apply these different operations to the quotations of 4. Nov. 1865, we see
                                that the quotation on London being 25.20 to 25.22<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>, and the

                                    25.15<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>.
                                Therefore, we can at the present moment (7 Nov. 1865) neither import
                                Engl. gold into France, nor export gold to England.</p>
            <p>The rate at New York against gold is 5.16. At that rate, which <hi rendition="#u">represents par</hi>, no operation of importation or

            <p>On the 5. of October, when the B. o. France raised its discount, the rate of exchange
                                rendered gold export absolutely impossible. The rate of bills on
                                London was 25.25, on the 9. October London paper was worth 25.28. In

            <p><hi rendition="#u">E. Pereire.</hi> The B. o. England puts its discount at 7%, and we
                            have it at 3. It is commonly said: „Since our discount is at 3, we will
                            send all our money to England to supply it at 7.“ But it is not
                            necessary in order to do that to send money at England. Bills of
                            exchange on London can be taken and kept in portfolio: in that way the
                            discount of 7% is secured without any displacing of money, for … gold
                            cannot leave France unless the exchange on London accounts to 25f. 37<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>c, in which case
                            the banker who might have taken London paper to get 7%, would have had
                            besides the profit coming from the rise in exchange. But in such
                            circumstances a rise of exchange is not to be feared. The bills of
                            exchange of all Europe are in great part centralised at Paris, and
                            thence they go in different directions: consequently one can find at
                            Paris as much paper on London as one wants, especially when France, for
                            the balance of her own exchanges, is not the debtor of England. There is
                            now (7 Nov. 1865) a difference of 2% between the discount rate of
                            B. o. F. and of B. o. E. According to the prevailing prejudices
                            speculators might profit by the difference of 2% to empty the till of
                            the B. o. F. and fill that of the B. o. E. But that is not done. There
                            goes not and cannot go a sovereign to England, because exchange is at
                            25f. 22<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>c. It is
                            impossible to send gold from here to London, and yet there is a
                            difference of 2% in the rate of discount. Ask the first bill brokers at
                            Paris, they will tell you that at this moment the sovereign
                                st<ex>erling</ex> in <hi rendition="#u">short</hi> paper on London
                            is bought at Paris at 25f. 22<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>c., and in paper of 3 months at 25f. 27<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>c., <hi rendition="#u">less the discount</hi> of 7%. A small profit is,
                            therefore, made on this difference of discount paper is taken at a<pb n="37"/> higher price when it is <hi rendition="#u">long</hi> in
                            order to obtain a higher discount. What is true for 2%, is true for 3 or
                            9, not for 10 or 20% … If 3% at B. o. F., 7% at B. o. E., there would be
                            a difference of 4, could not be continued long. How <hi rendition="#u">would it be corrected</hi>? By gold leaving the B. o. F. or
                            returning to the B. o. E.?</p>
            <p>If, during a month or two that state of things were to exist … there would be such an
                            advantage in taking at Paris paper on London, that none or much less
                            would be presented to the B. o. England, which would permit that Bank to
                            reconstitute its stock of notes, by the falling due of bills in its
                            portfolio; and thus the equilibrium prescribed to it by the bill of 1844
                            would be promptly re-established, without the least of the world
                            producing on the till of the B. o. France <hi rendition="#u">a

                                of the bills of exchange of the Continent.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">M. d’Eichthal:</hi> What does Pereire tell us? That if the
                                discount be 3% at Paris, and 7% at London, bankers will hasten at
                                Paris, the great market of exchanges, to take bills on London: they
                                will sell their securities, and receive in exchange paper on Paris
                                with which they will buy paper on London. But suppose the contrary
                                case. All the bills that I have on London I send to London, and I
                                realise my capital to buy bills on Paris. The effect of the
                                difference of the rate of interest, when it is higher at London than
                                at Paris, is then to keep out of England, by the attraction of high
                                interest, bills of exchange which but for that would go to be <choice>
                                    <sic>negociated</sic>
                                    <corr cert="high">negotiated</corr>
                                </choice> at London by the Bank of England. What does the Bank of
                                England do in raising its rate of discount? It <hi rendition="#u">compels all bills</hi> which would be presented to it to be
                                discounted, to remain on the continent, and that renders the money
                                less rare in England, and dearer in France. You are mutually
                                dependent, and in that state of things the exchange necessarily
                                rises. No, it is not necessary to send coin abroad: but when capital
                                becomes rare and dear amongst our neighbours, if you do not detain
                                it in France, they will come to take it; or in order terms, the <hi rendition="#u">debt which England has contracted remains in your
                                    hands</hi>, and it is your capital which pays the goods England
                                has bought. You have no cotton to buy in Ejypt. Granted; but the
                                debt of England comes into France, and you give credit to
                                England.</p>

            <p><hi rendition="#u">E. Pereire.</hi> You have too much experience of banking business
                                to maintain that when Engl. commerce is a debtor to foreign
                                countries for very large sums, an elevation of the exchange on
                                London is to be feared at Paris. The contrary takes place. If
                                England owes a great deal for the cotton, wool, wheat and cattle she
                                imports, that must augment the number of the bills of exchange drawn
                                on her. Those bills arriving at Paris in larger quantities must
                                bring down the exchange, and not make it rise. Now the fall of
                                exchange prevents the sending away of gold.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">M. Pastré:</hi> The <hi rendition="#u">exchange</hi> is not at all
                                a determining element. In India the interest is 14 to 15%. The
                                exchange indicates a very trifling profit; but as the discount is at
                                14 and 15%, masses not of gold, but of silver, are sent to
                                India.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">E. Pereire.</hi> It is not for the purpose of making investments
                            that silver is sent to India, but principally for the balances in
                            purchases of raw materials. When purchases of cotton have to be made in
                            India or Ejypt, it is not a difference of 1 or 2% in the interest on a
                            bill of exchange which will stop such an operation. When you buy cotton
                            at Alexandria, the complete operation is effected in 3 months, – that
                            time being necessary for sending, receiving, realising the affair.
                            Difference of interest of 2% p. a. is <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>% f<ex>ür</ex> 3 months, does not prevent the
                            operation. You and all the other merchants of Marseilles undertake the
                            operation only if you have a margin of from 12 to 15%. When you take the
                            chance of losing or gaining 10, 15, 20%, no <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>% of a temporary augmentation of
                            interest will stop you. The warnings (durch raising d<ex>er</ex>

                            retain Engl. bills of exchange which bring in 7%, and greatly prefer
                            taking them to accepting paper on Paris at 4 or 5. But as the demand for
                            bills on London at 7% augments the demands for bills at a long date, the
                            price rises, and the difference disappears – the level is

            <p>At this moment all persons concerned in making many of the newest <hi rendition="#u">minor</hi> railways are half ruined by it – the shareholders
                                and directors who have been led to incur personal liability rather
                                than that the line in which they are interested should stop in the
                                middle; the contractor who took his payment in shares of the co. now
                                worthless; the finance cos. which lent money on „Lloyd’s bonds“ of
                                the Co. and on bills of the directors-bonds now all but worthless,
                                and bills hard to get paid.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Three motives</hi> induce people to make minor railways in
                                England: 1) The greatest number are made <hi rendition="#u">out of
                                    contention</hi>. (Theils auf debateable land zwischen 2 grossen
                                cos. Dann the co. worsted in the mixed district, invaded the
                                antagonist cos’ peculiar district; that co. retaliated and so on in
                                a course surprising, for both parties half knew they were lessening
                                their income. 2) <hi rendition="#u">On speculation.</hi> A
                                contractor who sees a district which 2 great cos. both want, makes a
                                line there, and sells the line to the highest bidder. His trade
                                being construction, he generally gets a fair profit of his
                                adventure, and a large profit if the rival cos. are eager bidders,
                                though of late the high rate of interest and the quantity of such
                                    <hi rendition="#u">securities</hi> in the market have made it
                                difficult for him to get money on terms which would pay, have always
                                made his trade difficult, and often ruined him altogether. 3) <hi rendition="#u">On vanity.</hi> An engineer and a lawyer, sure to
                                gain, induce gentlemen of a district „on public grounds“ to take
                                shares in a railway and to become directors of it. Letztre oft
                                ruined.</p>
            <p>To insure good faith and solvency of the promoters, Parliament tried two ways:</p>
            <p>1) It prescribed a <hi rendition="#u">„subscription contract“</hi> to be signed in
                            sufficient amount by solvent persons pledging themselves to make the
                            railway. The subscription lists were filled with unsatisfactory names,
                            schwer to detect. Committee (Parl<ex>iament</ex>) in London no judge of
                            persons in province etc<supplied cert="high">.</supplied> System broke
                            down.</p>
                <p>2) <hi rendition="#u">Present plan:</hi> Parliament required <hi rendition="#u">a
                                certain sum of money or stock to be deposited by the promoters of
                                the line</hi>. The promoters simply borrow that money or stock on
                            their credit or on their securities; very commonly the lender’s name is
                            placed in the books of the B. o. E. along with that of the promoter’s;
                            the stock or the money does not go out of his possession, and when the
                            bill is passed, the borrowed capital is returned to the lender and is
                            not used to make the railway. Just before the „depositing“ season all
                            banks are besieged to lend their stock for this purpose, and its
                            deposit, in fact, shows neither <hi rendition="#u">bona fides</hi> nor
                            solvency; it shows only that the promoters can get a certain sum into
                            hands upon a secured promise to return it. There is often no company
                            when the bill is passed, even if there is afterwards. (So this plan has
                            also broken down.)</p>
           
            <p><hi rendition="#mMM"><hi rendition="#u">Many non-paying railways</hi> exceedingly
                                    benefit the places through which they pass, and do so even when
                                    no manipulation of fares would make them pay any better. It may
                                    often be <hi rendition="#u">for the substantial good of a whole
                                        district</hi> to have a railway,</hi> though that railway,
                                after the most remunerative settlement of fares, will only just meet
                                working expenses, and never yield a dividend. The reason is that the
                                railway benefits the <hi rendition="#u">stationary property</hi>
                                which you cannot charge as well as the <hi rendition="#u">conveyed
                                    property</hi> which you do charge. You can only make a line pay
                                its shareholders by taxing the people and things that travel on the
                                railway. But besides these the <hi rendition="#u">whole saleable
                                    value of the land</hi> of the district is enhanced sometimes
                                almost fabulously. A pretty residence near London, suitable to a man
                                of substantial business, if near a railway, will sell for a price
                                that could never pay the purchaser 2%. But if that residence was far
                                from a railway, it would not get into the market … <hi rendition="#mMM">The case <hi rendition="#u">of building land of
                                        poor quality is still stronger</hi>. The London Chatham and
                                    Dover railway does not pay a dividend, perhaps it is not likely
                                    to do so; yet, it is well known, that it has enhanced the value
                                    of the estates through which it passes, often very much. An

                                    in a few years worth 60,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, and other
                                    similar figures.</hi> In many cases no tariff will make these

                                enough to do more than keep the railway open, while all round the

            <head><hi rendition="#u">Meetings of Agricultural labourers.</hi></head>
            <p>The agricultural mind is disturbed. The <hi rendition="#u">Mark Lane Express</hi> is
                                unhappy. Cattle plague u. nun obendrein: the helpless labourers are
                                becoming less patient and less helpless in the <hi rendition="#u">matter of wages.</hi> Even in husbandry, there is in many
                                districts a demand for labour not altogether easily supplied. In <hi rendition="#u">Scotland</hi>, the meetings of the ploughmen and
                                other farm workmen have been numerous, and indicated much purpose
                                and good sense on the part of those workmen.</p>
            <p>Lately, however, there has been a <hi rendition="#u">meeting</hi> of <hi rendition="#u">agricultural labourers at Maidstone</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">Kent</hi> „for the purpose of taking into
                            consideration their present low wages, with the view of taking steps for
                            an increase thereof“. 4-500 labourers from all the neighbouring
                            parishes. It was agreed: „That this meeting is of opinion, considering
                            the great rise in provisions and other necessaries, together with the
                            fact that nearly every branch of industry had received an increase of
                            pay, that the farmers in this district be solicited to grant their
                            labourers an advance of 6d. p. day upon their present scale of wages.“
                            They also resolved „that an increase of 2d. on the shilling upon the
                            present scale of piece work be sought for as commensurate with that of
                            day-work“. Endlich: „that it is the duty of the employers to permit
                            their men to leave their work at 4 o’clock on Saturday afternoon.“ Of
                            course it must depend on the state of the labour market in Kent whether
                            the rural labourers have or have not any prospect of success … The
                            attempt, however, shows that there are some circumstances rendering
                            success to be apparently possible. At an adjourned meeting 600 labourers
                            were present, and then it was determined to memoralise the farmers of
                            West Kent in conformity with the foregoing resolutions. A 1000
                            signatures were rapidly attached to such memorial. Doubtless many
                            farmers will regard such a movement much as the workhouse dignitary
                            regarded Oliver Twist when asking for more. That seems in part the
                            spirit in which the <hi rendition="#u">Mark Lane Express</hi> deals with
                            it. Our <hi rendition="#u">contemporary also applies the sort</hi> of
                                <hi rendition="#u">the „mutual confidence“ argument so often and so
                                absurdly directed towards the farmers themselves on the part of
                                their landlords.</hi> … This is not a question of sympathy at all.
                            The landlord has made a hard bargain with his tenant, giving him scant
                            security, and many burdens, and drawing as much rent as can be got;
                            while the farmer, in his turn, drives the hardest bargain he can with
                            his men. … <hi rendition="#mMM">This pressure on the part of their
                                labourers arises out of the improving circumstances of the country,
                                its continuance is inevitable, its increase more than probable.</hi>
                            What is their remedy? They must relieve themselves from some of the
                            pressure they sustain from above; insist on rational leases; shake off
                            the game and the gamekeeper; require their landlords to do the necessary
                            landlords’ improvements, render their farms fit for the occupation of
                            enterprising and capitalist tenants. Let them do this, and they will
                            find there is a power, at present latent, in the soil to produce more
                            profits and higher wages.</p>

                    <hi rendition="#u">game preserves</hi>, wherein hares, rabbits and pheasants
                waste and consume the agricultural products, which naturally and economically would
                be applied by the farmers in the rearing and fattening domestic animals for

                            schwatzte at recent meeting of the Society of Arts, on deer forests and
                            Highland agriculture. The management of Highland property vermindre

                            small occupiers. A farm is seldom to be met with, and miles and miles
                            may be walked over without coming to a cottage. „The <hi rendition="#u">plan of depopulating the Highlands</hi>,“ sagt er, „and destroying
                            the crofters has been forced and carried to a point inimical to the best
                            interests of the country.“</p>
            <p>The crofters occupied land of which the rental for each holding was little more on
                                the average than 30<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> a year, and the plan
                                usually adopted was to turn out the tenants, burn down their

                                them into fishing villages on the seashores, and convert all the
                                arable land into pasture, on which sheep in large numbers were fed.
                                Though the climate is unsuitable for wheat, oats and barley could be
                                grown, and with roots and green crops would have largely increased
                                the capacity of the Highlands for sheep breeding. It may be
                                questioned, too, whether some amount of cattle should not have been
                                still bred. The crofters were in the aggregate extensive cattle
                                breeders, though of inferior sorts. <hi rendition="#u"><persName key="ed_vgw_4yt_qcb">Levi</persName></hi> sagt: „Under the

                                    mention the forests of Alyth, Athol, and Dummie, in Perthshire;
                                    of Balnagowan and Lewis, in Rossshire; of Boyn and Glenavon, in

                                    and the rat have lately made their way into the country. Immense
                                    tracts of lands, much of which is described in the statistical

                                    extent of very superior description“, are thus shut out from all
                                    cultivation and improvement, and are solely devoted to the sport
                                    of a few persons for a very brief period of the year.⦘</hi> It
                                has been gravely asserted that there is only a difference in the
                                kind of meat produced. But who will compare beef or mutton with
                                venison? Who eats venison as food? <hi rendition="#mMM">Beef is the
                                    sustenance of the many; venison is the luxury of the few.“ High

                                    the price paid by some overwealthy individual for the luxury of
                                    plunging for a few hours into the sports of the wilderness.</hi>
                                Is not this what was done by our Norman conquerors? … Allowing that
                                a certain amount of produce is extracted from the chase in venison
                                and grouse, the market value of such produce is inconsiderable and
                                altogether incommensurate with the expenditure incurred for such
                                forests, while the permanent injury committed on the land, and far
                                more, the withdrawal of such large portions of land from productive
                                purposes, especially from sheep and cattle, must be considered as
                                most injurious to the country at large.</p><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>

            <p>An irredeemable currency is a <hi rendition="#u">local currency</hi>. It only affects
                trade within the state, has no effect on trade between that state and other
                states.</p>
            <p>F. i. An English merchant ships goods to New York, sells them for greenbacks, cannot
                            use them in and have them remitted to England. He must buy one of 3
                            things with them, other <hi rendition="#u">goods</hi> or <hi rendition="#u">gold</hi>, or <hi rendition="#u">a bill of
                                exchange</hi>. When he buys either of these he suffers by the
                            depreciation of the currency as much as he gained before. At first, the
                            depreciation of the currency acts upon some commodities and not on
                            others; these articles desired by the first possessors of the new
                            currency are the first to rise, and then those desired by the second
                            possessors, – those who have sold their goods to the first, and so on
                            through society. But there is no general rule that imported products
                            should feel the influence of new money first; it all depends upon what
                            the first purchasers want to buy: those articles rise first, the rest
                            rise afterwards.“</p>

                            realisation in coin of the immobilised portion of its capital, that the
                            Bank o. France attained the same object. The year following, in 1848,
                            the capital of the B. o. France being again placed in <hi rendition="#u">rente</hi>, it was obliged to solicit from the Gvt. the suspension
                            of the cash payments for its notes. … the B. o. Engld. only needs the
                            power of issuing more notes, the B. o. France is in need of more
                            money.</p>
                            <p>There is no mutual dependence between the 2 establishments. The
                            B. o. France might easily maintain its discount when the B. o. Engl.
                            raises it rate. The proof is that now (26 Dec. 1865) there is a
                            difference of 2% between the 2 banks. The discount <hi rendition="#u">i</hi><hi rendition="#u">s at 4 in France, and 6 in England</hi>,
                            and <hi rendition="#u">yet gold from that country is constantly flowing
                                in here,</hi> which indicates sufficiently that the B. o. F. has
                            nothing to fear from the B. o. Engl. If the difference were to attain 3
                            or even 4%; the same would be the case, if the exchanges were in favour
                            of France. That fact, besides, is not new, for <hi rendition="#u">in
                                1847</hi> a <hi rendition="#u">difference of 3%</hi> long existed in
                            the discount of the 2 countries.</p>
            <p>When the Bk. o. E. raises its discount, a certain superfluity of <hi rendition="#u">bills of exchange payable at London</hi> comes naturally to Paris
                            to find an easier and more advantageous market. The B. o. France, in
                            such a case, instead of following the B. o. E. in its usurious policy –
                            to take itself part of these bills of exchange, and so aid our
                            neighbours. This indirect assistance, which would give it the
                            opportunity of very usefully employing parts of its funds, would
                            promptly put an end to the ephemeral crises which arise each year; it
                            would enable the B. o. F., if necessary, to exercise a salutary action
                            on exchanges, or … by the <hi rendition="#u">negotiation of those same

                                should have a tendency to rise</hi>, in a proportion disquieting to
                            its till. The Bank o. F. could besides if necessary employ those bills

            <p>The cotton market was heavy on Friday, and on Saturday a further and decided decline

                                    nominal</hi>. This extreme depression attracted the attention of

                                large business was done on Monday and Tuesday, accompanied by a
                                rally in prices. Yesterday upon later advices of full receipts in
                                the American parts the demand again fell off, and prices gave way.
                                This morning the existing want of confidence increased by the
                                announcement of the difficulties of a local bank, and business was
                                checked; as the day advanced there was more steadiness, but the
                                quotations still show a decline of about 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>d. to 2d. from last week’s

                            kind of financial devices by which the works themselves are started and
                            carried forward.</p>
            <p>Twenty years ago or less, when a railway was projected … people of some sort were
                            found to subscribe beforehand for the shares, and to bind themselves to
                            pay future calls till the line was made … with all the delusions and
                            iniquities of subscription contracts, it is substantially true that
                            until within a late period the costly public works of this country were
                            made by virtue of a previous agreement among a large number of <hi rendition="#u">bona fide</hi> subscribers, each prepared, or
                            believing he was prepared, to find his quota. In the numerous cases
                            where the adventure was a mistake, the loss and suffering were diffused
                            and severe, and the unlucky contributors were driven to straits and
                            economies painful to contemplate. … The pressure of the period of
                            excessive railway construction, from <hi rendition="#u">1845 to
                                1853</hi>, fell directly, as it ought to do, on the savings of the
                            country. The payments to the contractors were raised by calls from the
                            shareholders, and the shareholders paid the calls by saving out of
                            income, or by the sale of previous investments. But this system was
                            gradually exploded, and for the last few years has been given up
                            altogether. A <hi rendition="#u">project for a railway, dock, pier</hi>,
                            or other public work, requiring a large conversion of floating capital
                            into fixed, is now concocted by a knot of 4 or 5 persons, consisting of
                            a <hi rendition="#u">solicitor</hi>, an <hi rendition="#u">engineer</hi>, a <hi rendition="#u">parliamentary agent</hi>, a <hi rendition="#u">contractor</hi>, and a <hi rendition="#u">financier</hi>. Some of the party have the command of the few
                            thousands necessary to pay for surveys and indispensable preliminaries.
                            They have, in most cases, name and position enough to enable them to
                            borrow as much money as carries them as far as the Royal assent. That

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">example of London</hi> in removing its sewage from the river
                            has not been followed. The water below Oxford is useless for the

                            injury to the neighborhood had arisen from the irrigated fields, and
                            there was but a very slight smell from them in hot weather, just before
                            rain. According to Mr. Latham sewage is completely deodorised as it
                            touches the earth. But great care is needed in the management of the
                            sewer. They must be properly ventilated, and that outside the houses.
                            The sewage water must be passed over a sufficient area of land, and not
                            to near dwellings. But if these precautions be taken, the benefit of the
                            sewage water to the land is invaluable. It goes off from the land
                            bright, tasteless, and inodorous. Mr. Cousins, of South Norwood, who
                            rents some of the irrigated land, has raised crops of grass of 50 tons
                            of the acre. … <hi rendition="#u">Near Edinburgh, sewage irrigation has

                            the ordinary working of banking in England, a mechanism of diffused
                            credit economises the use <hi rendition="#u">of banknotes, of visible
                                instruments of exchange</hi>, of money in the ordinary sense of the
                            word. By the aid of the clearing house, of country bankers, of London
                            bankers, of the B. o. E. all working together … <hi rendition="#u">the
                                most important bargains are settled without the use of any banknotes
                                or coin whatever</hi>. A <hi rendition="#u">cheque</hi> is given,
                            and <hi rendition="#u">by the aid of the system of set-offs</hi>, this
                            bit of paper pays for cotton or indigo as effectually as sovereigns, and
                            pays for it in every part of the kingdom. Darin all wholesale
                            transactions settled. Mit Ausnahme d<ex>es</ex> North of England, where
                            a rather barbarous made of charging bank commissions restricts the use
                            of cheques and banking, no one pays any large debts except by cheque.
                                <hi rendition="#u">The wholesale currency of the country is a ledger
                                currency – a currency of bankers’ deposits transferred by bankers’
                                cheques</hi>. Banknotes in general, and in their customary use, are
                            but a retail currency. Small matters are settled <hi rendition="#u">by</hi> them; large matters are settled <hi rendition="#u">without</hi> them. In a <hi rendition="#u">panic</hi> this
                            auxiliary and supplementary currency is at once in part annihilated. Its
                            very <pb n="54"/> foundation is taken away. That foundation is credit,
                            and there is discredit. A person f. i. who has lent money on securities
                            will not take his debtor’s cheque and give up these securities. He asks
                            for banknotes. The general machinery by which bargains are settled and
                            debts paid in this country is <hi rendition="#u">in times even of
                                commencing panic</hi> disturbed and superseded. <hi rendition="#u">The Banknote is a most coarse form of credit</hi> as compared with
                            the cheque currency. Taking a banknote (even when not a legal tender)
                            only involves trusting the Bank; but taking a cheque presumes also a
                            trust in the cheque giver. <seg type="comment"><orig>(Viel weniger als

                                rendered absolutely innocuous, but also … perfectly idle. Do the
                                Gvt. really suppose, that Irish landlords will incur the risk of
                                indefinite claims being run up against them by their tenants if they
                                have it in their power to prevent this by the simple expedient of an

            <p>This <hi rendition="#u">panic more than any other we</hi> remember – <hi rendition="#u">a Credit Panic.</hi> The promises we have given to
                            pay gold on demand could not be performed by many thousand times as much
                            gold as there is in the country. And when this is the case our whole
                            mercantile system must always be easily injured by causes comparatively
                            slight … Last Friday (11 May) no one knew who was sound and who was
                            unsound … the <hi rendition="#u">lenders of money</hi> were <hi rendition="#u">suspected</hi> of misusing it. The panic of 1866 was
                            a <hi rendition="#u">credit panic</hi>, not <hi rendition="#u">a
                                capital</hi> nor <hi rendition="#u">a bullion panic</hi>.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Charter Act (1844) suspended.</hi> Just before the suspension of
                            the Act no bank was – considering the nature of its liabilities – in so
                            much danger as the B. o. England. It had a reserve of only 3,000,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> in town and country, and from all parts of
                            the country demands on that reserve were pouring in every hour. Country
                            bankers felt they must either get more notes and more sovereigns, or
                            give up their business; London bankers were pressed upon not only by
                            their country customers, but by a kind of oscillating run which now went
                            to this bank and now to that. The B. o. England could not have increased
                            its reserve by <hi rendition="#u">letting its bills „run off“</hi>; for
                            they would not have „run off“, but have accumulated <hi rendition="#u">unpaid</hi> in its bill case. … On Friday the London bankers
                            deposits in the B. o. E. amounted to a larger sum than its reserve.
                            These bankers would not – and some of them used plainly such language –
                            allow the B. o. E. to go on while they failed. Nothing is so imitative
                            as panic, and if 1 or 2 large bankers had drawn their balances, all the
                            rest would have followed like sheep, and the banking department of the
                            B. o. E. <hi rendition="#u">must</hi> have been left bare … In figures
                            its (the bank<ex>ing</ex> department’s of the B. o. E.) reserve looks
                            larger than that of its competitors, but only because it includes that
                            of its competitors. It was at least as badly off as they, for it existed
                            on their sufferance. … No considerable amounts of <hi rendition="#u">Consols</hi> can be sold at moments when the Bank is for such
                            purposes the only lender, and when it refuses to lend. The jobbers in
                            stock are men of means, but not masters of secret hoards of <hi rendition="#u">ready money</hi>. It is not a question of price but a
                            question of cash. In ordinary times if stocks come forward in unusual
                            quantities for sale, he can (the Jobber) with ease borrow on it, or
                            dispose of other securities to purchase it. But in a panic these „other“
                            securities are probably unavailable, and if the B. o. E. hesitate to
                            lend, the other resources of the market are very scanty. <hi rendition="#u">If</hi> the Bank were, in a panic, absolutely to
                            refuse to lend on Consols, they would not be saleable for cash.</p>

            <p>D<ex>ie</ex> Banks u. many mercantile firms drew only out notes to protect
                            themselves. Aber wahrscheinlich, daß wie in 1847, not a single note in
                            excess of the regulations laid down by the law will have been issued.

                            a real gain. The run was checked, the deposits were left alone; but it
                            was achieved by a process of the imagination; not a single additional
                            note was set to work … The Bank Act of 1844 neither made nor healed the
                            crisis; it had nothing to do with the matter; but the application of a
                            delusion respecting it did do good, and so far the mechanical has an
                            advantage over the discretionary issue of banknotes. It makes it
                            possible to use its abolition, and the substitution of the discretionary
                            method in its place, as an instrument supposed to be capable of working
                            miracles in a panic.</p>
            <p>In the hour of panic no one thinks of the gold as necessary for the B. o. E. note.
                            Before 1844, the banknote was accounted as safe, as solid, as it is now.

                            stoppage solely by the accidental discovery, not of bullion, but of a

            <p>The following curious notice to his tenants has been issued by Lord Denbigh to his
                                tenants: „As complaints have been made to me of the damage done by
                                rabbits in the cultivated parts of my property, and I am anxious to
                                meet the wishes of my tenants <hi rendition="#u">as far as
                                    possible,</hi> I have arranged <hi rendition="#u">with my
                                    keeper</hi> to destroy the rabbits <hi rendition="#u">as far as
                                    he can on the arable land</hi>; and in order to insure this
                                being attended to satisfactorily, I have given orders that 2
                                appointed rabbit-catchers shall be at the disposition of the tenants
                                from <hi rendition="#u">Febr. 15</hi> till the beginning of the
                                breeding season on the following terms: The tenants shall have full
                                leave to ferret all the hedgerous adjoining arable land on their
                                farms <hi rendition="#u">(excepting covert hedges)</hi> as often as
                                they like during that period, using neither dog nor gun, but only
                                purse nets over the burrows. All the rabbits so caught by each
                                tenant shall be kept by him, he paying the wages of the rabbit
                                catcher so long as he employs him. No tenant is to ferret without
                                being accompanied by the rabbit-catcher. <hi rendition="#u">In
                                    consideration of this concession I expect my tenants will
                                    preserve strictly for me all other game.</hi> As frequent
                                complaints have been made of self-hunting dogs being seen on the
                                property, I have given orders to my keepers to destroy all such
                                found hunting etc.“ <hi rendition="#u">Denbigh. Newnham Paddocks,
                                    April, <choice>

            <p>That which most vitally affects the farmer, the question of whether he is himself to
                                consume the crops he had paid for to Lord Denbigh, or whether Lord
                                Denbigh is to consume those crops by<pb n="59"/> means of his game
                                and rabbits, is to be arranged, not with the tenant, but behind his
                                back with his lordship’s keeper! It is proverbially said, you cannot
                                have your cake and eat it, but Lord Denbigh and his fellow
                                game-preservers have found out the way of doing so. They first take
                                rent for the use of their land, and then they consume for their own
                                profit and amusement the crops raised on the land by means of their
                                tenant’s capital.</p>
            <p>At the Aberdeenshire election now pending says Mr. Fordyce, the farmer’s candidate:
                            „From 1820 the Game Laws have gone on increasing until their number was
                            now almost legion.“</p>

            <p>Besser if the Act had been nicht nur legally, but really broken. It would have been
                                so, if the London bankers had not, to prevent it, sent in a lager
                                amount of small notes than usual. Considering how much be in the
                                country branches, 800,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> of notes is
                                childish as a reserve. In fact, the Act was broken the moment the
                                Bank began to act on the letter of this day fortnight; a course of
                                policy then began inconsistent with every clause of it. If the

                            quick. The same result also happens where, though no bad business had
                            been done by the Bank, its <hi rendition="#u">shares are in the hands of
                                poor people,</hi> who can bear no loss and<pb n="62"/> pay no calls.
                            Such people rush to sell the moment the price falls; and the <hi rendition="#u">„bears“ thrive on their ruin</hi> … A fearful penalty
                            is visited on incidental errors, and concerns which might have crippled
                            on and got right, are <hi rendition="#u">by the depreciation of their

                                wanted to supply its place. On what is called <hi rendition="#u">„Overend’s Friday“</hi>, the want of such currency was
                                palpable, and it was given. The Act of 1844 is responsible not for
                                the present want of credit but, but <hi rendition="#u">for the
                                    difference</hi> between the acute agony which preceded the

                                Certainly, Peel’s Act is a legal ligament which inflames panic into

            <p>During the last 20 years provisions of all other kinds have become lower and more
                                stable in price, while <hi rendition="#u">meat</hi> had <hi rendition="#u">advanced in value far more than other food has
                                    diminished,</hi> so that even m<ex>it</ex> better wages our
                                working men find themselves no more able to furnish their families
                                with a fair amount of meat than in the old days before Repeal of the
                                Cornlaws. The importations of foreign live stock do, <hi rendition="#u">to a small extent</hi>, supplement and increase
                                our own supplies. Probably preserved meat will by and by be derived
                                from those pastoral countries where hides and wool have hitherto
                                been deemed the sole produce of herds and flocks.</p>
            <p>There is not the slightest doubt that if the land of country were properly used and
                                managed, and far grater population than that now living in these
                                islands might be fairly supplied with meat at a reasonable price. It
                                is not by the diminution of our grain that we shall increase our
                                meat. <hi rendition="#u">In modern husbandry</hi> more cattle and
                                sheep on a farm imply and furnish the means of growing more grain,
                                while the increase of grain – with its accompaniment straw – is the
                                origin of more stock and stock<pb n="63"/> provender.</p>
            <p>„Practically“, says R. Smith, in a lecture at the London farmer’s club, „it depends
                            first (increased supply of animal food) on the <hi rendition="#u">investment of capital</hi> to increase the fertility of the soil;
                            secondly, on the <hi rendition="#u">subsequent improved rotation of
                                crops</hi>, so as to secure a larger percentage of cattle food
                            produce with increased economy and decreased waste in its consumption;
                            thirdly, on <hi rendition="#u">improved animals</hi>, with precious
                            habits, as fattening stock, whether cattle, sheep, or pigs … For such a
                            purpose <hi rendition="#u">the strong lends</hi>, which hitherto have
                            done but little in the way of increasing the supplies of animal food,
                            should be used <hi rendition="#u">during the summer months for growing
                                green crops</hi>. This ought to be to <hi rendition="#u">the
                                occupier of clay soils</hi> what the <hi rendition="#u">winter
                                feeding</hi> is to the <hi rendition="#u">occupier of light
                                soils</hi>. Cabbages, early turnips (sown on a stable furrow)
                            mangolds, and kohlrabi may be grown on clays, the two former in time to
                            be eaten upon the land by the end of September, and the two latter to be
                            drawn off, stored, pulped, and used with wheat straw chaff. In this way
                            all the straw not absolutely wanted for litter, may be advantageously
                            eaten, and, with the aid of oil cake and crushed corn, a good deal of
                            mutton and some beef (the former pays best) may be made from the produce
                            of those soils, the occupiers of which have hitherto <hi rendition="#u">relied upon wheat and beans</hi> only. This change of system would
                            require <hi rendition="#u">autumn cultivation</hi> for all the green
                            crops, and so raise <hi rendition="#u">the question of efficient
                                drainage and steam cultivation.</hi> In dieser question einbegriffen
                            the whole array of questions and difficulties which beset, trammel, and
                            impede Brit. husbandry. Efficient drainage, with its necessary
                            concomitant, sufficient building accommodation for stock must be the
                            work of the landlord, an outlay of capital to be compensated by interest
                            in the shape of increased rent, – to be followed by outlays by the
                            tenant in improved cultivation and stock management which any farmer
                            must be absolutely insane to make unless protected by a long and
                            rational lease. Then steam cultivation can only follow as a result from
                            these other and preliminary improvements. And to render steam
                            cultivation possible there must be a grubbing up of hedgerows and the
                            removal of hedgerow timber, which must be done by the landowner as a
                            capitalist, and completely, too. It is if no use to grub the hedges and
                            leave the timber standing (as we so frequently see) in the midst of an
                            arable field, greatly impeding ploughs with horses, and presenting an
                            absolute bar to steam cultivation. Yet when landlords have consented to
                            the grubbing of hedge-rows, even at the tenant’s expense, they object to
                            the removals of the trees, leaving them as evidences of prejudices at
                            once childish and unintelligible. Yet these prejudices are the serious
                            obstacle to the progress of Engl. agriculture.</p>
            <p>Ferner <hi rendition="#u">obstacle</hi>: <hi rendition="#u">The feudal notions which
                                infect all that concerns the ownership of land in Engl.</hi> It is
                            tenacity with owners of land to retain the ownership – very often <hi rendition="#u">only the nominal ownership</hi> – of much more land
                            than they have the means of managing. Hence we have, in a modified form,
                                <hi rendition="#u">many of the evils which affect the Irish
                                tenantry</hi> – farmers occupying farms in which many of the most
                            necessary improvements – necessary according to the actual <hi rendition="#mMM">state of Engl. agriculture – must either be made by
                                the tenants or left undone. The result is, <hi rendition="#u">especially on the strong soils</hi> referred to by Mr. Smith as
                                those on which more live stock ought to be kept,</hi> that the
                            improvements are not made. In fact, <hi rendition="#u">the strong lands
                                of England are less productive of meat than they were a century
                                ago</hi>, and mainly because they cannot be well farmed without
                            considerable preliminary outlay on the part of the landlord.</p>
                            <p>Ferner <hi rendition="#u">poultry</hi> much neglected. Smith says:
                            „The <hi rendition="#u">late Mr. Pusey told us, 1838,</hi> that while
                                <hi rendition="#u">England Wales contained about 37 millions
                                acres</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">Scotland Ireland about 20 mill.
                                each,</hi> there were in the U. Kingd. <hi rendition="#u">20
                                millions of acres laying waste, one half of which might be
                                improved</hi>.“ Ferner Smith adverts to <hi rendition="#u">the want
                                of economy</hi> which <hi rendition="#u">results from the yearly
                                tenant system</hi>, which is <hi rendition="#u">the curse of English
                                husbandry</hi>.</p>
            <pb n="64"/>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">„Economy in Agriculture“</hi>, he says, „is a most important means
                                by which an increased supply of animal food may be attained, the
                                greatest of all being the increased fertility of the soil resulting
                                from a liberal investment of capital <hi rendition="#u">and a
                                    security of tenure,</hi> the fixed payments of a farm, such as
                                rent, rates, and taxes, being the same; while, on the other hand,
                                nothing can be well worse than the <hi rendition="#u">waste of
                                    capital</hi> where <hi rendition="#u">tenants are „farming in
                                    and farming out“</hi>. There is <hi rendition="#u">economy in a
                                    good education;</hi> for, while a proper knowledge of the <hi rendition="#u">natural sciences</hi> is essential to profitable
                                farming, it is equally important to understand the principles by
                                which nature’s laws are governed. There is <hi rendition="#u">a
                                    method economy</hi> even in <hi rendition="#u">well formed
                                    animals</hi>, as <hi rendition="#u">improved machinery at the
                                    farm factory</hi>, where the animal heat and the proportions of
                                the boiler have alike to be consulted.“</p>
            <p>Amongst other improvements he strongly recommended <hi rendition="#u">covered yards
                                for stock</hi>. There, he says, „the cows having done growing would
                            be placed in stalls to economise place, the fattening animals in warm
                            boxes, the young growing stock would run loose in the centre yards, and
                            the juniors would be placed in suitably arranged calf-pens; in the
                            immediate vicinity of which are well-arranged root, chaff, meal, and
                            mixing houses, which by their concentrated position afford <hi rendition="#u">an economy</hi> of labour, food, and suspension.
                            Again, <hi rendition="#u">as the economy of warmth is a well known
                                equivalent for food</hi>, so do <hi rendition="#u">covered
                                yards</hi> economise feeding stuffs, while the <hi rendition="#u">even temperature</hi> of the building promotes both health and
                            happiness. Covered yards are the things to save food; the cattle and
                            food are all close together: what one won’t eat another will; nothing is
                            wasted; and it is a capital thing pulping the roots and mixing them with
                            the chaff. The best of all is, they don’t get washed by the storms.
                            Their coats are alike … They lie about like cattle on grass in the
                            summer time, and don’t take near so much litter as the open yards.“</p>
            <p>Mr. Cousmaker said: „too much importance could not be attached to the <hi rendition="#u">system of breeding</hi> … they ought to <hi rendition="#u">combine the breeding of stocks</hi> with <hi rendition="#u">its <choice>

                            One of the causes of this escape was that he had not for years bought
                            stock. He bred at one end and fattened on the other, and he never bought
                            or sold, except to the butcher, beyond buying about once every 2 years a
                            yearling bull, for the sake of change of breed.</p>

                            do not yet esteem themselves secure from further withdrawals, they are

                            for that purpose he laid waste the country in Hampshire for an extent of

                                said</hi>: „The legalised protection to wild animals in the Highland
                            was most severely felt in reference to the peculiar products of that
                            country. <hi rendition="#u">Two millions of acres had been laid totally
                                waste, embracing within their area the most fertile lands of
                                Scotland.</hi> The natural grass of Glen Tilt were among the most
                            nutritive in the country of Perth. The deer forest of Ben Aulder was by
                            far the best grazing ground in the wide district of Badenoch; a part of
                            the Black Mount forest was the best pasture for blackfaced sheep in
                            Scotland. Some idea may be formed of the ground laid waste for merely
                            sporting purpose in Scotland from the fact that it embraced an area
                            larger than the whole county of Perth. The resources of the forest of
                            Ben Aulder might give some idea of the loss sustained by the country
                            from these forced desolations. The ground would pasture 15,000 sheep,

                            might be roughly guessed that the country was deprived by the forests of

                            sheep. All that forest land was totally unproductive, never having

                            Highlands was now almost exploded. People had begun to see that the

                            banks and finance cos. to which that monopoly has given birth. These
                            institutions are at present freed from the obligation of holding
                            metallic money as the basis of their transactions, while they have, by

                            separation of the power of affecting prices, and the responsibility of

                                give for them a comparatively high rate of interest. On the other
                                hand it employed these deposits in loans to other members of the

            <p>All panics in a large sense are <hi rendition="#u">credit panics</hi>. Aber
                                    d<ex>er</ex> of 1866 specially so. <hi rendition="#u">The fabric
                                    of credit may be disturbed:</hi> 1) By our <hi rendition="#u">transacting too much business</hi>, and, as a consequence, <hi rendition="#u">engaging in too many undertakings</hi>. We may
                                promise more than we can perform. There is only at the annual
                                disposal of every nation a certain fund set free by the annual
                                industry for production. We have only a certain set of commodities
                                u. nur by their help we can keep our engagements. So far as they
                                suffice we can do so, but when they cease we must fail. In such a
                                case a panic arises from <hi rendition="#u">a scarcity of
                                    capital</hi>. We have not enough things to do what we have
                                promised. Something of this sort <hi rendition="#u">in 1847</hi>. We
                                had made so many <hi rendition="#u">promises to build railways</hi>
                                which were halfmade and were constantly requiring to be finished,
                                that a large number of persons had to break their promises, that the
                                rupture of these engagements caused first difference – then distrust
                                – then panic. This could not be helped in 1847, for the error was in
                                1845 and 1846. A capital panic arises from our having made more
                                promises than we can perform.</p>
            <p>2) <hi rendition="#u">Bullion Panic:</hi> Though the ultimate object of all contracts
                            is to <hi rendition="#u">obtain capital</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">procure commodities</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">universal language
                                in which contracts are expressed</hi> is <hi rendition="#u">money</hi>. The debtor undertakes to produce such and such
                            sovereigns; the creditor absolves him from all claims by receipt in full
                            when he does so. We have to keep our promises not only in articles, but
                            in money. Indeed at first sight a person looking only to the terms of
                            the contracts would say that we need money only, and need money only,
                            and need nothing else. And in law such is the case. But money will not
                            make a railway. You must have land, sleepers, rails and labour. If these
                            are scarce, the more money you have to spend on them, the more their
                            price will rise. But money, though not sufficient, is plainly necessary,
                            and in the last resort actual sovereigns. Banknotes, credits in ledgers,
                            deposit receipts, <hi rendition="#u">are only so many different forms of
                                contract to pay sovereigns</hi>. Our <hi rendition="#u">whole credit
                                system</hi> may be described as an engagement to deliver gold and
                            silver when required, and until a good stock of these metals is kept for
                            that purpose, there is no assurance that such contracts will be
                            performed. Without much of those metals many those contracts could not
                            be performed. The public knows this, and as soon as the stock of money
                            in the country runs low, they begin to doubt if contracts to pay money
                            will be performed. In <hi rendition="#u">1847</hi> this happened:
                            bullion was then scarce as well as Capital; a <hi rendition="#u">bad
                                harves</hi><hi rendition="#u">t</hi> had created a <hi rendition="#u">sudden demand for bullion to pay for foreign
                                corn</hi>, and the B. o. E. did not then know to keep a stock of
                            bullion. In <hi rendition="#u">1857</hi>, also, the B. o. E. allowed the
                            stock of bullion to get very low, and a panic came on in
                            consequence.</p>
            <p><pb n="74"/> 3) The <hi rendition="#u">speciality of 1866</hi>: we had nearly enough
                                bullion and capital, and panic as severe as 1847 and more severe
                                than 1857. We have now 14,800,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> bullion.
                                We have never had less than 11,800,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>
                                <hi rendition="#u">1847</hi> we had 8,312,000£. u. <hi rendition="#u">1857</hi>: 6,484,000. As to our <hi rendition="#u">capital</hi> the test is not so easy. Was die <hi rendition="#u">investments</hi> angeht,</p>

                            the main quite as it should be. The bill currency in which international
                            transactions are settled is now disordered, and as we receive more
                            bullion than we used to do, so we ought for the same reason to pay away
                            more. We need not thus to augment our bullion beyond the amount which we
                            commonly think about enough. The B. o. E. have till now retained some of
                            the gold which passes through the country, but now they need not do so.
                            A part of the remittances from America are upon German account. The
                            Germans who invested in American securities when very low are now
                            realising and bringing both their principals and profits home. Such
                            remittances must go to Germany, and it is preposterous to try to retain
                            them by a high rate of discount. Mit Bezug auf such money, the
                            maintenance of the rate is an ineffectual means towards an undesirable
                            result. <hi rendition="#u">Bullion in the Bank of France</hi>, increased

                            <p>There is no reason why 10% should be fixed in Gladstone’s (treasury)
                            letter of 11 May any more than a less rate. As money gets cheaper, the
                            growth of auxiliary credit is likely to become more rapid; it will begin
                            to increase when money ceases to be 10%. A letter in which the rate is
                            prescribed requires a series of postscripts.</p>
            <p>The protracted continuance of this crisis makes this variation of rate during the

            <head><hi rendition="#u">The Mode of Dealing in the Bank Shares. („Bearing“)</hi></head>
            <p>Mr. Leeman, the member for York, has brought in a Bill to regulate the traffic in
                            Bank or other shares. He proposes in substance that no one shall sell
                            Bank or other shares unless he already possesses them, and as a test of
                            his already possessing them, he requires that they shall be described,
                            if possible, by the number of the shares in the register, and when there
                            is no register, in the next most intelligible manner. The object of
                            course is plain. <hi rendition="#u">A great number of persons have acted
                                as „bears“</hi>, that is have <hi rendition="#u">sold the shares of
                                some particular banks which never owned</hi>, have depressed the
                            price of these shares and have ruined the credit of the bank.</p>
            <p>Of course, where the Bank perished, the speculation was most profitable; the „bear“
                                sold Agra and Masterman’s share at a premium for future delivery,
                                thereby depressed the market price, and bought them afterwards if
                                necessary when they were at a discount. Such operations certainly
                                profitable to those who deal in them, and certainly disastrous to
                                those whose property is so dealt in.</p>
            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">prohibition</hi>, if there is to be one, ought to be a <hi rendition="#u">legal prohibition</hi>, and not a prohibition by

                                whole jurisdiction of that Committee is an anomaly. Why any
                                particular set of men – in fact a sort of „<hi rendition="#u">Trades’ Union</hi>“, – should have the power to regulate the
                                traffic in millions’ worth of property is very strange. … diese

                                of bad cos. Overend and the Agra are obvious cases of concerns which
                                might for years have gone, and might have got worse and worse if it
                                had not been for this affective and shringent effect. (Sehr

            <p><hi rendition="#u">Manchester. June 28.</hi> Towards the end of last week telegrams
                                of 17. inst. from Culcutta and Bombay were received here, reporting
                                favourably of these markets, in the face of very adverse advices
                                from this side to the 7. inst. This dispelled the depression
                                previously existing here. Considerable business done, before close

                                fall. Later telegrams from Bombay, rumouring the suspension of large
                                Parsee firm, contributed to check further advance. To day business
                                decidedly limited, but the extension of the engagements of
                                producers, since the 21<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> prevents much

                                and, if it is so acting, its conduct not wise and prudent. <seg type="comment"><orig>⦗On the contrary! They acted very prudently
                                        – for their own pockets! They used the letter only to buy a
                                        tax of 10% and allow their reserve to run down to any
                                        amount. They issued too many notes – according to their own
                                        theory – in proportion to their reserve, that is, in
                                        proportions to their banking liabilities they cared nothing
                                        for any reserve whatever. But in proportion to their Bullion
                                        they did, by their note issue, not infringe on the Act of
                                        1844. They did not want to do this, 1) because, by the
                                        Treasury letter, they would then have been obliged to <hi rendition="#u">pay so much to the state</hi>; 2) because

                                        1844 – instead of their real one – threatened to give the

            <p>Früher dieß immer d<ex>er</ex> Fall. The apprehension hier um so grösser when it was
                                seen that large sums in gold were paid by America to England. Aber
                                1) The <hi rendition="#u">connection between the U. St.</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">Eng</hi><hi rendition="#u">l</hi><hi rendition="#u">and</hi> violently broken by the civil war. Our
                                commerce has begun to grow again with stupendous rapidity. But
                                still, the trade being recent, <hi rendition="#u">has not yet had
                                    time to create</hi> that close, intimate, and indissoluble union
                                between the 2 countries which there was in former times. Allied
                                houses here did not as formerly pull down allied houses in New York,
                                because allied houses are not so common – at least not so closely
                                bound as once – and because houses of that sort failed in any great
                                numbers here. We had <hi rendition="#u">very few mercantile
                                    failures</hi>.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#mMM">2) The large payments which America has <hi rendition="#u">made
                                    to us in bullion</hi> would undoubtedly have deeply affected her
                                    <hi rendition="#u">if bullion had been the basis of her credit
                                    system</hi>. But it is not so; <hi rendition="#u">greenbacks are
                                    its basis now</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Gold is there simply an
                                    article of common merchandise.</hi> As long as they have „lawful
                                money“, they can get <supplied cert="high">on</supplied> without
                                gold or without silver.</hi></p>
            <p>3) What has happened is this. When it became necessary to remit gold to Europe, gold
                                rose rapidly in value; and the <hi rendition="#u">Gvt</hi>., <hi rendition="#u">which</hi> is the <hi rendition="#u">principal
                                    holder of gold</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">sold freely</hi>. The
                                Gvt. is always a large holder, because it receives Custom duties in
                                coin, and only pays the interest of part of its debt in coin – an
                                out-going much less than the receipt. A balance of gold, is,
                                therefore, constantly accumulating in the treasury, and a large item
                                of miscellaneous revenue is composed of „profit“ on gold sales.
                                Specie dollars are received as before the war, and, as if there were
                                no greenbacks, at the Customhouse, and so credited in the books, but
                                when <hi rendition="#u">surplus comes to be sold</hi>, it yields in
                                „lawful money“, in the common currency in which Gvt pays its way, a
                                large percentage more, and that <hi rendition="#u">premium is added
                                    to the revenue</hi>. When, in consequence of the remittance to
                                Europe, the price of gold as measured in greenbacks rose, the Gvt.
                                hastened to sell, in order to gain the additional premium. The sum
                                wanted, therefore, for commerce was supplied without trenching on
                                the wants of commerce or the habits of credit.</p>
            <p>This <hi rendition="#u">facility of meeting sudden foreign payments</hi> may seem <hi rendition="#u">a great advantage in the system of</hi>
                                inconvertible currency, and in truth so it is. D<ex>ie</ex>
                                disadvantages overweigh it. The constant, incalculable, illimitable
                                variations in the price of commodities, the feeling that the price
                                of everything, and, therefore, the property of every man, may be
                                reduced at any moment for the Gvt. convenience; the disturbance of
                                debts; the impossibility of long credit, because no one can make
                                contracts <pb n="79"/> for a long time in a currency which may
                                during that time be wholly changed in value.</p>

            <p>Husbandry in this county has come to be carried by farmers possessed of considerable
                            capitals, who hire their farms at yearly rents from the proprietors of
                            land. <hi rendition="#u">The division between the occupation and the
                                ownership of land is complete</hi> … <hi rendition="#u">It is the
                                fact that the owners of land do not perform their part in the work
                                of production. On the vast majority of farms in England,</hi>
                            permanent outlays are required to be made in effecting permanent works,
                            which would constitute investments of a capital – additions to the value
                            of the property – the return for which would consist of <hi rendition="#u">increased rental</hi>, and which, as the rule, can
                            only be properly and prudently made by the owner. In ordinary cases the
                            tenant cannot prudently invest his own capital in executing those
                            permanent improvements, viz: <hi rendition="#u">draining, building, road
                                making</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">removal of superfluous fences
                                and timber, straightening and deepening brooks and outfalls for
                                water, warping, irrigation</hi>, and so forth. It is not too much to
                            say that <hi rendition="#u">fully <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> of the fee-simple value</hi> of the farm
                            ought to be and might profitably be so laid out by the landlord <hi rendition="#u">upon 3 farms out of 4</hi> throughout England. Until
                            that is done farmers cannot farm their land properly, cannot make the
                            profits or raise the produce of which <hi rendition="#u">the capacity of
                                the land</hi> aided by modern <hi rendition="#u">skill and
                                appliances</hi> would admit. Why then are not these permanent
                            outlays made? The chief reasons are that the owners of land are not full
                            owners, but are so restricted by entails and settlements to be only life
                            tenants, while the estate will go exclusively to their oldest son. <hi rendition="#u">They are to a large extent only nominal owners</hi>,
                            because the estates being charged m<ex>it</ex> debts, jointures,

                            part of the rental is applicable to the satisfaction of these
                            encumbrances. Then, when the estate is encumbered, <pb n="81"/> – and

            <p>The public appear to suppose that this thing is peculiar to them Stock Exchanges;
                            while the fact is, it prevails in every business of any extent, where
                            prices have more or less of fluctuation. It is just as common to sell
                            corn, or cotton, or iron, or tea, or any produce whatever, <hi rendition="#u">for a fall</hi>, as it is to sell shares. The simple
                            difference is, that in case of stocks or shares the various shades of
                            prices and almost every particular transaction is noted and publicly
                            quoted; while in the case of produce the transactions are only noted in
                            the lump, with the general prices of the day. Moreover, the thing is
                            carried <hi rendition="#u">on every</hi> day on the Stock Exchange,
                            while in produce it is pretty well confined to market days. But still
                            the practice really prevails as much in one case as in the other. Every
                            man in business of any magnitude often <hi rendition="#u">sells first
                                and buys afterwards.</hi> In Manchester, f. i., a spinner, just as
                            often as otherwise, <hi rendition="#u">sells yarn for future
                                delivery</hi>, when perhaps an ounce of it is not spun, hoping and
                            thinking that he can cover, <hi rendition="#u">by buying cotton in
                                Liverpool in a few days or a week an advantage</hi>. What is this
                            but <hi rendition="#u">bearing</hi> the markets? „If a seller of shares
                            is to be compelled to produce vouchers that he actually possesses them,
                            why should not every merchant be compelled to do the same before he
                            enters upon his transactions? … It is supposed that „a bull“ never takes
                            his stock up, and that „a bear“ never delivers what he has sold while in
                            other business he does. Now this is simply a mistake. A „bull“ of shares
                            at the end of every account must, and does, either take up his stock or
                            get others to do it for him, or he must lend it to some one who wants to
                            borrow it. One of these things he must do, and always does, and the
                            seller invariably gets his money for his stock … In what business is
                            more done than paying for what is bought. On the other hand, it is not
                            true that a „bear“ never delivers the stock he sells. On the contrary,
                            when he sells he enters into a distinct engagement that he <hi rendition="#u">will deliver</hi> at the end of the account, and he
                            always does. He <hi rendition="#u">either buys back before the end of
                                the account, or he borrows from</hi><pb n="82"/>
                            <hi rendition="#u">some one</hi> who wishes to lend, or in some other
                            way he gets for delivery what he has sold, and the buyer invariably gets
                            the shares he has bought. What more can the seller do than provide that
                            the shares shall be ready at the time stipulated, <hi rendition="#u">which is never longer than</hi>
                            <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>

            <p>The fact is, it is not the liberty to sell and buy shares that has produced the
                                supposed mischief in the late transactions in bank and finance
                                shares, but first, the reckless mismanagement and rotten state of
                                the banks themselves, and next, the <hi rendition="#mMM"><hi rendition="#u">„Organisations“ which have been formed to

                            of bad business. If you leave much money in people’s hand to employ it
                                <hi rendition="#u">for their own advantage</hi>, and they cannot so

                            recondite bad business. John Bull, it has been said, „can stand many

                            bad business is likely to be undertaken.</p>
            <p>In general the <hi rendition="#u">mercantile community</hi>, excited by the facility
                                of obtaining money, engage in mercantile adventures properly so
                                called, and their failure, when it occurs, is generally of vast
                                magnitude. It is then that <hi rendition="#u">capital panics</hi>
                                are generated. A whole nation of industrious men of business are
                                excited by a long continued facility, and rush into adventures which

                                this happens the <hi rendition="#u">banking firms</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">holders of loanable capital</hi>, are relieved
                                from this <hi rendition="#u">surplus accumulation</hi>; it is
                                carried off in this <hi rendition="#u">surplus trade</hi>. And
                                though that trade be bad, it <hi rendition="#u">does not follow that

                                people’s debts and expiate other people’s follies. <hi rendition="#u">But still the banker gets out.</hi> He is not
                                ruined. He witnesses tranquilly the ruin of others. But it sometimes
                                happens that the banker is not willing to wait till the expansion,
                                possibly the excessive and too sudden expansion of trade brings new

                            accounts. Ebenso waren, obgleich nicht so viele wie jezt, many banks in
                            large towns and great seats of industry, but the smaller towns had no
                            banks. The system of banking now takes the savings of quiet country

                            profitableness and usefulness. In former times this was not done
                            completely, and in many districts was hardly done at all. Engl. Banking

                            reserve, invested the money of the bank in some business of their own,
                            and in a time of difficulty had no available resource. In <hi rendition="#u">1793</hi>, in <hi rendition="#u">1825</hi>, and other

                            enterprise than the improvements of Engl. banking 30 years ago. There
                            were excessively few banks to receive the deposits of the richest nation
                            in the world, and many of the existing banks were bad ones.

                            extreme. The number of new banks of various kinds – some Indian, some
                            provincial, some foreign, but all London too – which started in those
                            years, was extreme. Each wanted to make a great and sudden profit on a
                            considerable capital; each offered a large interest for money, since it
                            could not make anything till it had money; each compelled others to give
                            that interest too, or they would lose the funds which were the means of
                            their livelihood and the implements of their trade. Just <hi rendition="#u">when the natural interest of money was low</hi>,
                            because there was a difficulty in lending it well, a new class of money
                            dealers sprang up who bid high for it, and therefore were almost obliged
                            themselves and almost forced others to employ it amiss.</p>
            <p>With <hi rendition="#u">discount companies</hi> the effect, though different, was
                                even more pernicious. A great many new cos. were founded, and they
                                came into competition with <hi rendition="#u">Overend, G. et
                                Co</hi>. Overends, an old firm quite insolvent, and propping up its
                                great reputation, by high rates of interest, could not let the money
                                go, and the new cos. wanted to make the money come. Between the two
                                the rate of interest given by <hi rendition="#u">intermediate
                                    borrowers</hi> so to speak – by borrowers who insisted<pb n="84"/> to lend again – was forced up to an unreasonable amount, and yet
                                the rate of profit on actual undertakings, the earning fund, the
                                productive capacity of the country, remained where it was. The <hi rendition="#u">specific danger of the time</hi> was the <hi rendition="#u">accumulation of loanable capital</hi> in the
                                hands of those who did not know how to use it because the profits of
                                active capital were at the moment so small, and yet, partly form the
                                competition of banks and partly form the foundation of discount and
                                finance cos, the rate of interest given by these intermediate
                                holders was beyond all precedent excessive and dangerous. Greater
                                folly than has been committed by banks and discount cos during the
                                two last years has never be known before.</p>

            <p>A shareholder only sees the half-year’s accounts – in too many cases carefully
                                prepared to meet his eye, and concealing under delicate ambiguities
                                and well-contrived words exactly what it most concerns him to know.
                                Attendance at a halfyearly public meeting mostly useless. A public
                                debate on a co’s matter has rarely, if even, done it good; and a
                                single shareholder can scarcely generate a debate at such a meeting
                                if he desires it. The directors in office never wish it, and while
                                the co. is prosperous, can always prevent it. After the co. is
                                ruined, of course there are discussions enough.</p>
            <p>Of the principal directors who start a co. are leaving it as if in terror; if they

                                their shares and diminishing their responsibility – there is
                                something wrong. If the directors are selling their shares, other
                                welljudging people sell theirs too. The whole co. is weeded of its
                                rich capitalists, and left to women, clerks, and vagrants.</p>

                            unusual supply of foreign money. But this money was lent us on credit,
                            leaves us mit impaired credit. When you create by law a limit to the
                            issue of banknotes, you entail by inevitable events occasional acts of
                            the Executive to break that law. The foreign discredit occasioned by
                            such acts must not be charged to them. They are part and parcel of the
                            Act itself –, inseparable from it. So are the evils they cause. Ferner:
                            the Act led the B. o. E. to keep the rate of interest higher than it
                            ever was for so protracted a period. Mit gutem credit, the more interest
                            you offer the more money will you get; as soon as your credit is
                            doubted, the <hi rendition="#u">higher the rate you offer, the less the
                                money will come in</hi>. Dann high interest means <hi rendition="#u">bad</hi> security. And the foreign holders of bills on England have
                            lately largely acted on it. … For a moment all large holders of a
                            commodity have great power over its price, and at a moment of panic the
                            B. o. E. has nearly despotic power over the price of money. If the
                            B. o. E. had charged 15% for the last 6 weeks, the general market would
                            have approximated to it, and been guided by it more or less nearly.</p>

            <p>Long is England treated as an axiom that <hi rendition="#u">feeding cattle</hi> were
                            merely <hi rendition="#u">manure making machines</hi>, and expensive
                            machines too. The profit was looked to from the <hi rendition="#u">corn
                                crops</hi>, whose increase formed the purpose of all the elaborate
                            processes of stock feeding. The beasts had as much cake or corn as they
                            would eat for long periods of time, besides large quantities of hay or
                            root. Hence Loss, charged to the manure. The Scotch farmers long in
                            advance of the Engl. farmers in this respect, that by the consumption of
                            their turnips with straw they chiefly produced their fat cattle; though
                            in their case also when any artificial food – cake or corn – was used,
                            they usually gave too much and too long – that is, for profit.
                            Hauptsache: Skill in selecting, – in breeding and buying the store stock
                            – and careful management in feeding them. Dieß subject of 2 papers, one
                            by Mr. <hi rendition="#u"><persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000002228">George

                            as they fatten easily, have little offal, and get flesh on the parts
                            that fetch the highest prices per lb. Coarse and large boned animals are
                            invariably large consumers of food, while their meat is of less value.
                            Warmth and comfort are of great importance in promoting feeding, and the
                            cattle ought to be separated into small lots. The greater the
                            subdivision or the smaller the number in any one place, so much the
                            better do the animals thrive in ample shed room or cover is
                            indispensable for profitable feeding. „In the Lothians, the cattle
                            feeding was long considered as merely subservient to the production of

                            gradually eats less and less; he rests more and becomes fatter. And it
                            is at this stage that cattle pay best for linseed cake and rich feeding,
                            and it is most profitable to give it to them without measure. Feeders
                            frequently lose the best part of their profits from selling their stock
                            a month or 6 weeks too soon. An ox may be very good, fat, and readily
                            find a purchaser; but if kept on for another month, or even 2, he would
                            increase more rapidly in weight in proportion to the food consumed than
                            he ever did at any previous stage of his existence, and also from
                            becoming extra quality, he would be worth from 3 to 6d p. stone

                            to open up communication with, and thereby to utilise and render
                            productive, an interior teeming with the means of wealth, but lying
                            comparatively destitute for want of a method of intercourse; and to
                            facilitate the gvt. of the country by rapid communication and easy
                            transit of troops. The direct railways now on the verge of completion

                            shows that the system of guaranteed Indian railways comprises a length
                            of 5000 miles, of which about <hi rendition="#sup">2</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> finished. The track is for the most part
                            single; clear now that f<ex>ür</ex> grossen Theil it must be doubled,
                            perhaps more than doubled. At present the cost estimates for the double
                            line are confined to <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> only of the entire distance, and with that provision the
                            minimum estimate for the 5000 miles is 81 mill. st., or something more
                            than 16,000£. per mile. With <hi rendition="#u">nothing to pay for

                                relatively to the receipt. A mile of railway costs no more for

                                the profit of Indian railways increases more rapidly than the

                            speculative rise of prices, which checks exports, increases imports, and
                            drives capital out of the country. Required some means by which the rate

                            does in the opposite direction … Though the rate of interest ultimately
                            conforms to the rate of profit, it reaches upon it, and if it were
                            possible to secure a <hi rendition="#u">permanently</hi> low rate,

                                        if in the one case we give a long credit, and in the other
                                        are paying ready money, the <hi rendition="#u">balance of

                                            our favour.</hi> That such was the case at the
                                        commencement of the late crisis, and is usually the case at
                                        similar periods, there can be no doubt. We had extended our
                                        credits beyond our means. Our capital was absorbed to an
                                        inconvenient extent by foreign shipments. What was the
                                        natural remedy? Not to increase our exports, but rather
                                        circumscribe our transactions, reduce our foreign credits,
                                        and wait the arrival of remittances as they fell due for
                                        shipments already made. At such times the <hi rendition="#u">commerce of the country</hi> is placed in a <hi rendition="#u">condition</hi> of partial <hi rendition="#u">liquidation</hi>. Liquidation can be, and
                                        is, effected as much by commodities as by gold. The same
                                        motives which induce to large shipments of gold to England
                                        at such times, lead also to shipments of
                                        commodities.“</orig><note xml:id="nq4c_qsz_yhb">The

            <p>Similar changes have often occurred in our railway expenditure and in our trade
                without causing an augmentation in the value of money either similar or
                comparable.</p>
            <p>It is true that a part of this railway expenditure has been effected in a mode
                                    singularly calculated to affect the money market. These railways
                                    have in part been made by bankers who advanced money to
                                    constructors and others. Such loans are in the nature of an <hi rendition="#u">extra</hi> and additional conversion of
                                    floating capital into permanent or fixed capital. The usual
                                    course is that the proprietors and makers of the annual savings
                                    of the country, after letting them lie as it were <hi rendition="#u">in transitu</hi> in some banks, <seg type="comment"><orig>(Wie soll man das anfangen,
                                                d<ex>ie</ex>
                                            <hi rendition="#u">annual savings</hi> in einer Bank <hi rendition="#u">liegen zu lassen</hi>?)</orig><note xml:id="nqgp_v5z_yhb">Kommentar von Marx.</note></seg>,
                                    invest them on their own account. The banker holds a fund
                                    permanent in amount, but made up of many changing items.</p>
            <p><pb n="91"/>The customary accumulation of the country passes through the bank, but
                                    does not rest there. But if in addition to this normal and
                                    natural process, the banker on his own account begins <hi rendition="#u">to invest in a permanent form the deposits
                                        left with him</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">pressure on the
                                        short loan market</hi> is necessarily greater. The ordinary
                                    outgoings made by the owner go on as usual, and the
                                    extraordinary outgoings made by the banker have to be met as
                                    well. The rise in the rate of interest consequent on investments
                                    in railways made by the banker out of his deposits, all else
                                    being equal, will be more than from similar investments made by
                                    common individuals from ordinary savings.</p>
            <p>But these observations only apply to <hi rendition="#u">investments by banks</hi>,
                                not those of <hi rendition="#u">finance companies.</hi> The latter
                                are the channels into which common people have chosen to throw their
                                money. These are not like investments from <hi rendition="#u">bankers’ reserves</hi>, but common investments from ordinary
                                savings. Nor, again, do those observations apply to loans on
                                railways made by the banker at first, but then repaid to him by
                                individuals. These, again, are but the ordinary investments by
                                individuals, forestalled, indeed by the banker, but repaid to him in
                                the end. And the whole argument as to the peculiar effect of a
                                banker’s investments is subject to an important distinction.
                                Banker’s means have of late largely tended to augment. The high rate
                                of interest, offered, not only in London, but generally through the
                                provinces, has filled the coffers of banks with money which else
                                would have been embarked in permanent investments by the owners of
                                it. Accordingly bankers have had more than usual to invest, and
                                common people have been willing to invest less. <hi rendition="#u">Ordinary operations have not gone on as usual;</hi> they have
                                been diminished at the moment when the investments by bankers have
                                been increased.</p>
            <p>The substantial conclusion remains that there is no evidence, that an increased
                                investment of loanable capital is cause of the value of money being
                                    2<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> times
                                as great now as at this time last year. The <hi rendition="#u">aggravating cause is the credit</hi> – a panic from bad
                                business. The inevitable effect of a loss of credit, especially <hi rendition="#u">loss of banking credit</hi>, is to send up the
                                rate of interest very rapidly. Persons under large obligations must
                                borrow largely on their securities, and for a moment, even on the
                                best securities, it is difficult to get money. The large loans by
                                the B. o. E. would have quite met this difficulty, and long ere this
                                the panic would have died away; but unhappily we had as a <hi rendition="#u">country been trading upon borrowed capital</hi>.

            <p>The foreign exchanges have now been turned, notwithstanding the discredit drain. They
                                now bring gold here and take it to the Bank. This panic has happened
                                in the <hi rendition="#u">spring</hi>, and from a concurrence of
                                2 causes money is always dearer in the autumn. 1) There is usually a
                                tide of coin in the hands of non-banking classes, consequent on the
                                harvest. 2) The imports of England from tropical and other countries
                                being vegetable raw products, are dependent on the seasons, and
                                happen to arrive here, and therefore happen to be paid for, in the
                                latter part of the year. <hi rendition="#u">Most panics have
                                    happened in November</hi>, in the naturally dearest month of the
                                money market, and the reaction towards cheap money occurred at a
                                time when money would usually have tended to be cheaper. But this
                                panic has occurred in the summer, and the consequent reaction will
                                fall upon the period when money would naturally become dearer. The
                                present movement towards cheap money will therefore be a mitigated
                                movement, while those of <hi rendition="#u">1847 et 1857</hi> were
                                intensified movements. The usual rate of interest has risen since
                                1847 and 1857, and the number of ways of carrying off and investing
                                surplus money have largely increased.</p>

                            said that the colour was at times almost an ochre, and that it took out
                            the colour of silks and satins. Its action on metals was to deposit a
                            thin film, which eat into the metal if not removed every day, and
                            necessitated <choice>

                            </choice>. These complaints had not arisen in the same business at
                            Liverpool, while at Clapham the gas was rather worse than in
                            Regentstreet. The effect on leather, as proved by a boot maker was utter <choice>
                                <sic>rotteness</sic>
                                <corr cert="high">rottenness</corr>
                            </choice>; the witness produced a boot that had never been worn, and
                            tore up the leather as if it had been blotting paper. He had sold
                            hundreds of these boots at 1s. and 1s. 6d. a piece, though they had cost
                            him 18s. to 20s. … Dr. Letheby found as much as 10 grains of oil of
                            vitriol in two inches of the leather, and he mentioned a case where
                            2 volumes of a work were bound at same time with the same leather, and
                            one remained on the shelf in a room lighted by gas, while the other was
                            taken away by a reader. After a considerable time this volume was
                            restored by the reader, and its binding was sound, while that of the one
                            of the<pb n="94"/> shelf was rotten. M. Hedley, a gas engineer,
                            described the gas as subject to variations; „occasionally during the
                            middle of the evening, it is as if a cloud passed over the gas.“ He
                            observed too that the gas was so overcharged with ammonia, „that when
                            the servants washed the globes of the chandeliers they complained that
                            it was just like standing over a bottle of smelling salts, the smell of
                            ammonia was so strong in the water.“</p>
            <p>It was proved that at Manchester 22 candle gas was supplied at <choice>
                                <sic>3.s.</sic>

                            </choice> per 1,000, while the illuminating power required in London is
                            14 candles, and the price is 4s. 6d. Mr. Baxter, solicitor to the <hi rendition="#u">gas cos.</hi>, says that if the illuminating power is
                            to be 14 candles at the end of 6 miles, it must be 17 candles at the
                            works, and that Newcastle coal will not make more than 14 candles.
                            Dr. Letheby, however, says that gas will travel 6 miles without losing
                            any illuminating power and proved it. At Hastings they are making gas
                            from Newcastle coal, and they are producing 14 candle gas at the very
                            end of St. Leonards. In Birmingham the works are 6 miles from the town,
                            they use Derbyshire coal, and supply gas of 14<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> candle.</p>
            <p>But if there is no reason why our gas should not be better, sufficient reasons for
                            our having no redress under the present system. <hi rendition="#u">Fälschung d<ex>er</ex> tests und Kapitalmacht baffling the legal
                                proceedings of individuals:</hi> The <hi rendition="#u">tests are
                                notoriously evaded,</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">attempts to enforce
                                the Act</hi> are met by technical objections which no doubt would be
                            cleared away in process of law, but which show that the Cos. are
                            resolved to fight to the last, and have the means of commanding the best
                            legal assistance. „There have been some futile efforts made occasionally
                            by some desperate men (to put the Act in force), but they have died
                            off“, says one witness. Another says it would be knocking your head
                            against a post to appoint a gas inspector. The result of the inspection,
                            as admitted by Dr. Letheby, proves this.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the <hi rendition="#u">test is applied with a
                                specific pressure to a particular burner</hi>, while the consumers
                            have no control over the pressure, and have not generally the same
                            burner. Then the <hi rendition="#u">testing houses provided by the Cos
                                are often unfair</hi>; in one of them the walls are not blackened,
                            and a large reflector is placed in the room so as considerably to
                            enhance the illuminating power. The ease with which the tests may be
                            defeated appears from the evidence of several engineers. The <hi rendition="#u">Co has 3 hours notice before the test is to be
                                applied</hi>. So lange dieß d<ex>er</ex> Fall, the test must prove
                            inadequate. „By throwing a little cannel coal into a retort“, says
                            Mr. Hedley, „or changing a certain number of retorts according to the
                            size of the work, you may change the quality of the gas 6 miles off in a
                            quarter of half an hour; or by having a system made at the entrance of
                            the gas works by pouring spirits of petroleum or coal-tar naphtha into
                            it, as the week gas goes through it will lick it up, and you can
                            increase your 10 candles to 16 candles as the gas travels.“ Mr. Hedley
                            did this himself at Uxbridge, to convince Dr. Letheby. „Whilst he was on
                            the works I converted 12 candle gas into nearly 15 candle <choice>
                                <sic>gass</sic>
                                <corr cert="high">gas</corr>
                            </choice> in less than <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> of hour.“ Another engineer says the same effect can be
                            produced by a slight mixture of photogenic oil, the gas might be raised
                            5 or 6 candles in value under the eye of the experimenter without his
                            knowing that any trick was being played upon him.</p>
            <p>Dr. Letheby shows that during the last 16 months the violations of law of which 3
                            Cos. were guilty amounted in one instance to 71%, in another to 58, and
                            in another to 48% of all the testings … To the question, „What is poor
                            man to do if he gets a grievance from the gas Co.?“, we have the reply,
                                <hi rendition="#u">„Why, to be robbed and submit to it – nothing
                                else.“</hi>

            <p>In England and France, the banking reserve is kept by a single bank. Country Bankers,
                            as a rule, only keep the minimum of cash sufficient for their daily
                            wants; their reserves, properly so called, i. e. their extraordinary

            <p>The banks themselves have a small circulation, but as it amounts to only <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">9</hi> of the total
                                liability, we can easily suppose it forfeited to the Gvt., and
                                sufficient sum struck off both sides of the account. The entire
                                reserve would then be, as almost all of it is now, <hi rendition="#u">kept against the banking liability</hi>. The
                                general result of the 59 Banks:</p>

                            which the reserve in the banking departments bears to the <hi rendition="#u">total liabilities</hi> not of the B. o. E. only, but
                            of this country. The reserve is distributed about equally between all
                            the banks; those who have the greatest liabilities have the largest
                            reserve, and umgekehrt. Here is an example of many banks, each of which
                            keeps its own reserve.</p>
            <p>A single bank, overtopping and overpowering all others, feels that its credit is too
                            good to be questioned. The B. o. E. and the B. o. F. know that happen
                            what may they are sure to be in good credit. But when a considerable
                            number of banks keep the reserve of a country, each feels that its
                            position depends on its own prudence. If it does not keep a reserve
                            which will meet the demands upon it, when those demands arise, it will
                            fail.</p>
            <p>Again, a number of banks are much more likely to be independent of State control than
                                a single bank. <hi rendition="#u">A single predominant bank is
                                    always the banker of the Gvt.</hi> It is connected with it by
                                relations the most intimate. It receives its taxes, advances its
                                loans, gets to be called the <hi rendition="#u">national bank</hi>.
                                The credit of the nation and the stability of Gvt. come to be borne
                                up with its reputation, and in a time of difficulty the State must
                                come to the aid of the bank. It will suspend an Act of 1844 or make
                                an Act of 1819; it will authorise a suspension of cash payments;
                                authorise everything necessary to enable the bank to continue its
                                operations and do the business of the Gvt. Ist nicht the case
                                    m<ex>it</ex> any ordinary bank. It is not the basis of national
                                credit, and could not be treated as if it was so.</p>

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">characteristics of 1866</hi>: a complete exhaustion of the
                            national capital in enterprises of all kinds, at home and abroad, and
                            the vast amount of engagements to furnish more capital. It is to the
                            vast extension of deposit banking, and to the absorption of capital by
                            new Cos., that our main difficulties are mainly to be attributed. By
                            deposit, as opposed to ordinary banking, is here meant that form of
                            banking in which the depositor receives interest on the sum placed or
                            left in the banker’s hand. Solche banks existirten seit long in
                            Scotland. Only introduced in London since about 30 years. Has been since
                            then gradually growing in importance and now threatens to swallow up the
                            system of ordinary banking, as still carried on by private firms. The
                            sums thus held in London probably about 150 mill., in the British
                            Islands must exceed 300, perhaps reaches 400 millions. The limited
                            liability Cos., (other than banks, discount and finance Cos) are all
                            collectors, some of them also distributors of capital; the object of the
                            latter class being to make loans either to individuals or other bodies,
                            while the former employ their money in mercantile or industrial
                            occupations of their own. … The mode in which it was proposed to raise
                            the capital for all these cos., both banking and miscellaneous, was by
                            instalments, and this fact had a material influence on the march of
                            events, and largely contributed to the exhaustion of the money market.
                            The shareholders paid their deposit and the first call with little
                            regard to the necessity of meeting subsequent calls, or to their means
                            of doing so.</p><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/>

            <p>There was a most startling revelation of the mode in which <hi rendition="#u">railway
                                debentures are issued</hi>. As soon as the power of issuing
                            debentures is obtained, large numbers are at once issued <hi rendition="#u">en masse</hi>, and a loan raised upon them. As the
                            public, i. e. as real investors, ask for debentures, new ones are
                            granted. But when the limit of the borrowing powers is reached, this
                            process becomes very dangerous. The public money comes in in exchange
                            for new debentures, and with this money the existing loans are paid off,
                            and the old debentures redeemed. But almost necessarily the new
                            debentures are issued before the old ones are got in. There is a moment
                            when both the new and the old are running together. And sometimes <hi rendition="#u">the money received in exchange for the new
                                debentures</hi> is <hi rendition="#u">not used in paying all the old
                                debentures</hi>. This happened in the case of <hi rendition="#u">the
                                    Lond<ex>on</ex>, Chath<ex>am</ex> and Dover</hi>: the Co. was in
                            great difficulties, their financial agents, <hi rendition="#u">Peto et
                                Co</hi>, were under immense obligations, and the money was issued
                            for other purposes. Hence <hi rendition="#u">128,000</hi> debentures
                            have been issued in excess of the borrowing powers, and there the <hi rendition="#u">public</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">real
                                investors</hi>, hold. The <hi rendition="#u">first and good
                                debentures</hi> were only <hi rendition="#u">advanced</hi> upon by
                            bankers and others.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Rankin</hi>, a railway solicitor of the greatest experience,
                            says <hi rendition="#u">this is the general practice of railways
                                companies</hi>. Who can be sure, then, that <hi rendition="#u">his</hi> debenture – legitimate one, and not, <hi rendition="#u">a
                                fraud</hi>? The credit of railway debentures as a security will not

                            confining the area of the land powers it grants, and probably a future
                            juries will compel railway cos. to pay a price for their land higher

                            barley still uncut – is very considerable. In the <hi rendition="#u">Midlands</hi> bes<ex>onders</ex> schlechte arable cultivation. The

                            were simultaneous; this year the harvest in the North is fully 3 weeks
                            later than in the South.“ Wheat on all high-conditioned loams,
                            welldrained clays and deep chalk soils will be a fair average, and the
                            grain well developed. The area of wheat is gradually diminishing as not

                            the other grains. Barley crop is rapidly supplanting wheat wherever the

                            who have payments to make from country A to country B buy in country A
                            as cheap as they can good bills – bills sure to be paid – upon
                            country B. When these bills get very scarce, their price rises, or,
                            their „premium“ is augmented, and at a certain point it becomes better
                            to <hi rendition="#u">incur the loss of interest</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">the expense of carriage</hi>, and the <hi rendition="#u">cost of insurance</hi> incident upon the <hi rendition="#u">transmission of bullion</hi>, rather than to pay a
                            premium upon bills unusually augmented. But such a scarcity of bills and
                            such a premium are <hi rendition="#u">exceptional</hi>. The <hi rendition="#u">balance of international payments</hi> is settled in
                            the precious metals; the ordinary current payments are made by bills.
                            But a bill is an instrument based on credit: Its value depends on the
                            fact that the acceptor can pay and will pay. When credit is disturbed,
                            all the first class bills in the market rise in value; everybody knows
                            them and competes for them, but the inferior bills no one touches.
                            Accordingly the premium upon first class bills – upon the only bills
                            practically useful – becomes considerable, and bullion is accordingly
                            transmitted. This happened <hi rendition="#u">in America,</hi> as soon
                            as the news of the panic here reached that country. Immediately, there
                            was a great demand for bullion as a remittance, and, under ordinary

                            in the East now. The premium on the best bills has become so great that
                            even the Indian gvt are ready to send bullion. The very same cause, the
                            distrust of longdated bills accepted in England, makes distant
                            countries, as India and America, send us bullion, and makes near
                            countries, as France and Germany, take our bullion.</p>
            <p>Generally, if England receive money from India, it is perfectly certain that she will
                                not have to send money to India. <hi rendition="#mMM">But <hi rendition="#u">when credit is deranged bullion may easily

            <p>The law has been systematically evaded; published accounts have been totally
                                misleading; many persons – some probably of small means – have been
                                altogether deceived; a property of great natural value has become of
                                no value at all. Daher Lond<ex>on</ex>, Ch<ex>atham</ex>,

                                group“ connected by a personal union. The several sections have a
                                common board of directors, but in other respects they are always
                                independent, and sometimes hostile to each other. The largest davon
                                is „the <hi rendition="#u">General Undertaking</hi>“, has 116 miles
                                out of 136, u. the next largest are the <hi rendition="#u">„Metropolitan extensions“</hi> (14 miles). Und the „General
                                Undertaking“ has taken off many small lines, and has subsidiary
                                agreements peculiar to itself. Besides which there is a „common
                                fund“, a sort of general contribution from all the units, and
                                regulated by laws of its own.</p>
            <p>The Lond<ex>on</ex>, Chat<ex>ham</ex>, and Dover is a <hi rendition="#u">„contractor’s railway“</hi>, … was made by borrowing money, not by
                            subscribing capital. „Since 1860“, say the investigators, „Messrs, Peto
                            et Co. have subscribed for the whole share capital of the Co. of every
                            kind, and such capital was subsequently placed upon the market by
                            Messrs. Peto et Co., either on their own account, or in some instances,
                            as they allege, on behalf of the Co.“ These loans were often secured by
                                <hi rendition="#u">Peto et Co’s acceptances</hi>, and have been
                            floating about Lombardstreet these 6 years, growing each year larger and
                            larger.</p>

                                useful. A legal impediment certainly existed. Parliament required

                                „certified to be so by a justice of the peace“. But in the year 1864

                                in the books of the Co., the only authority for the entries being
                                the receipts above-mentioned. Upon this the statutory declaration
                                was made, and a certificate of a justice of the peace obtained in
                                order to bring the borrowing powers into operation, <pb n="103"/>
                                whereupon the full amount of debentures authorised (356,300<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>) were issued and are still
                                outstanding.“</p>
            <p>These documents are in fact, two mutually destructive fictions. The contractor
                                acknowledges the receipt of money never paid on account of work ever
                                done; the co. acknowledge the receipt of capital subscribed by the
                                contractors which never was subscribed. <hi rendition="#u">Debentures were then issued</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">their
                                    produce</hi> is the only real money ever actually expended on
                                the Eastern Section. We doubt the legal effect of this „balance
                                entry“ of two deceits; but its financial effect is certain, the Co.
                                got 356,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> by it which they still owe on
                                debenture.</p>
            <p>But this legal impediment thus adroitly encountered, was not the only one which the
                                    Lond<ex>on</ex>, Chath<ex>am</ex>, and Dover met with. After the
                                right to issue debentures had been obtained, the amount of
                                debentures so to be issued is limited; it must <hi rendition="#u">not exceed <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi></hi><hi rendition="#u">/</hi><hi rendition="#u"><hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> of the
                                    paid up capital</hi>. There are 2 ways in which debentures may
                                be used. First, they may be issued to the lender in the usual way,
                                to be held by him or his assigns till they run out; or they may be
                                pledged in the money market to bankers and others for temporary
                                loans, to be repaid when the time fixed for such short loans is
                                expired. But there is a difficulty about using both modes. If a Co.
                                pledges all its debentures to bankers and money dealers, it has none
                                to give to the ordinary investor who wants one, and yet it is on the
                                ordinary investor that at last everything depends. The
                                    Lond<ex>on</ex> Ch<ex>atham</ex>, and Dover did, through Peto et
                                Co., pledge all its debentures, and when common investors wanted
                                some, issued new ones, and <hi rendition="#u">trusted to Peto et
                                    Co’s redeeming the old ones, which they did not always do</hi>.
                                New and old ran on together, and a <hi rendition="#u">large amount
                                    of illegal debentures</hi> is outstanding still.</p>

            <p>Everywhere, Mr. Fawcett pointed out, the class of labourers is combined together in
                            large masses, and weighing itself against the class of the capitalists,
                            who wish to dictate the terms of labour … All over the country we hear
                            of these combinations and counter-combination. The masters are
                            distrusted, the men are defied; time, which is all important to the rate
                            of profit, is lost. Capital locked up in valuable machinery is lying
                            barren while these <hi rendition="#u">articles of war</hi>
                            <pb n="104"/> are discussed. … So long as every great adjustment of
                            terms between capital and labour has to be fought out, a great part of
                            the natural advantages of this country for productive purposes must be
                            lost in paying for the great waste of time, savings, and profits
                            involved in fighting it out. … The only certain way of palliating this
                            evil, is, the growth of such associations such as Messrs. Brigg’s Coal
                            Co., in which the interest of the capitalist and the labourer are so
                            completely identified, that, instead of higgling for terms, the workmen
                            will be glad enough to take whatever rate of wages seems most
                            reasonable, in the full certainty that if they are being underpaid, they
                            will receive the difference at the end of the half-year in a bonus from
                            surplus profits. The plan at Messrs. Brigg’s is to pay, first, the

                            the co, and finally to divide the surplus between the capital and the
                            labour, so that mere labourers, even without a share in the Co., receive
                            a bonus at the end of the half-year if the profits exceeded 10%. This
                            plan has been found to conduce to economy of time and material to a
                            degree scarcely credible to those who have not tried it. … Mr. Briggs
                            explained that the result had been not only to put a good bonus into the
                            pocket of the labourers – a bonus of 5% on their wages – but to yield to
                            himself, as capitalist, a larger profit than he had ever before
                            received, even in the most prosperous years of the colliery’s
                            existence.</p>

            <p>The continued <hi rendition="#u">low price of securities</hi> still excites remark …
                            During every crisis, and still more, before every crisis, loans are
                            contracted which cannot be repaid till it is passed away. The securities
                            upon which these loans were effected cannot be realised till the agony
                            of the panic is passed; but when the panic is over, the lenders begin to
                            require them to be realised. They call in their loans and at any price
                            the securities must be realised. Such especially the case now, because
                            the class most hit is the class possessing securities … . A large number
                            of excellent shares have been pledged during the last few months to pay
                            up calls in failed and futile Cos.</p>

                            both by the Co. and Peto as debentures. The Committee of Investigation
                            state expressly: „Cheques were drawn from time to time on the joint
                            account and delivered to Messrs Peto and Co. to the amount, in the

                            must have believed they held „debentures“, when both the Co. and Peto
                            treated them as debentures. Now Peto says they are not. Dieß kommt hinzu

            <p>„Demand and supply, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied will be made
                                equal. If unequal at any moment, competition equalises them, and the
                                manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the value. If
                                the demand increases, the value rises, if the demand diminishes, the
                                value falls; again if the supply falls off, the value rises; and
                                falls if the supply increased. The rise or the fall continues until
                                the demand and supply are again equal to one another; and <hi rendition="#u">the value which a commodity will bring in any
                                    market, is no other than the value which, in that market, gives
                                    a demand just sufficient to carry off the existing or expected
                                    supply</hi>.“ <hi rendition="#u">(Mill. Pol. Econ.

            <p>F. e. Mill says: „if the demand increases the value rises“, but the necessity for
                            this entirely depends on the new demand being of such a kind that it
                            will advance on the current price, <hi rendition="#u">whatever that
                                price may be</hi>: short of this the demand might increase without
                            producing the slightest tendency to a rise of value. And so of the other
                            factor of the problem. „If the demand diminishes, the value falls“,
                            which requires for its truth the analogous supposition with regard to
                            the holders of the commodity, viz. that they are prepared to sell at any
                            sacrifice rather than withdraw their goods from the market. Where both
                            these conditions are fulfilled, where demand and supply are both without
                            reserve, where purchasers, numerous enough to absorb the existing
                            supply, and sellers are each determined at any cost the one to obtain,
                            the other to dispose of, goods will doubtless sell or tend to sell in
                            conformity m<ex>it</ex> Mill’s law. Let us endeavour to present to
                            ourselves the state of mind in which buyers and sellers enter an
                            ordinary <hi rendition="#u">wholesale market</hi> – we say <hi rendition="#u">wholesale market</hi>, as it is there that
                            competition comes most freely into play. The great majority of dealers
                            have probably already formed some notion, more or less precise, of <hi rendition="#u">the price</hi> at which the commodity – the subject
                            of the bargaining – ought to sell. This they take as their guide in
                            their subsequent operations, allowing themselves however, to be drawn
                            from it in one direction or the other by what they find in the market.
                            If the purchaser finds the demand greater than he expected, he will be
                            prepared to advance a little upon his ideal standard; while the holder
                            of the commodity, in the opposite condition of the case, will on his
                            side be prepared to make some concession in a decline of price. In
                            general … these limits within which either will feel inclined to move in
                            a direction opposed to his interest as buyer or seller will not be very
                            great, though cases will occasionally happen when the market will reveal
                            conditions of which both were before in ignorance, and may induce either
                            to deviate widely from his original judgement. As a general rule,
                            however, the data on which all, whether purchasers or sellers, form
                            their opinion as to a legitimate price – the price, we mean, at which in
                            the actual state of the market it is considered safe to trade – are
                            pretty nearly the same. These data are what they know of the state of
                            consumptive demand on the one hand and the supplies coming forward or
                            expected to come forward on the other. … The object of their dealing is
                            in general the same – to obtain the current profit on their
                            transactions. Instead of the indefinite elasticity of <hi rendition="#u">demand on the one side</hi>, and the <hi rendition="#u">equally
                                indefinite urgency to sell on the other</hi>, which Mill’s theory
                            assumes, we should have sellers and purchasers conducting their
                            operations within very definite limits – limits which for the great
                            majority on either side would not lie very widely apart.</p>
            <p><pb n="106"/> Mr. Thornton not „merely points out some inaccuracies in the ordinary
                            statement of the law“, but, as it seems to us, proves that <hi rendition="#u">no „law“</hi> of demand and supply, in any sense
                            which has yet been assigned to these words, exists; that neither in
                            fact, nor in tendency, do <hi rendition="#u">market prices</hi> conform
                            to the rule which is commonly supposed to govern them. … What a theory
                            of market prices ought to give us is a statement of the conditions which
                            determine them. … <hi rendition="#u">All the phenomena of value</hi>
                            which are not of a strictly temporary value are referred by the existing
                            doctrines of polit<ex>ical</ex> economy, not to demand and supply, but
                            to the principle of cost, that principle no doubt acting through demand
                            and supply. … the modes and conditions under which demand and supply
                            affect prices (marketprices) are so numerous and complicated that they
                            do not admit being brought into a precise formula, but can only be set
                            forth in a number of distinct propositions more or less connected.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Demand for labour</hi> is a demand without reserve, since it is
                                    <hi rendition="#u">the means by which the desire for
                                profit</hi>, –<hi rendition="#u"> an insatiable desire</hi> – seeks
                                to satisfy itself. Dieß sagt er dagegen daß nach Thornton labour
                                „forms a notable exception to the rule, that commodities are almost
                                never offered unreservedly for sale“.</p><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/>

            <p>There seems <hi rendition="#u">no end of the railway scandals</hi> which this crisis
                            will detect. While money is plentiful it can be borrowed, and used to
                            pay dividends, debenture interests, any one in fact whom it is
                            convenient to pay. But when money cannot be borrowed, these claimants
                            become first irritable, then importunate, finally aggressive, upon which
                            the latent sin is at once discovered. In the case of the North Brit.
                            Railway no debentures have been issued in excess, no Act of
                                Parl<ex>iament</ex> intended to protect lenders has been violated,
                            but <hi rendition="#u">a series of erroneous accounts have been palmed
                                upon the shareholders</hi> and the public, and <hi rendition="#u">confirmed by dividends distributed</hi>, on the faith of which
                            ordinary shareholders believed they had an excellent property, and <hi rendition="#u">preference shareholders</hi> – in several sets – lent
                            money to the concern. <hi rendition="#u">The fraud</hi> here is a <hi rendition="#u">business, not a legal fraud</hi>; it consisted <hi rendition="#u">in publishing false figures</hi>, not in
                            transgressing Parl<ex>iamentary</ex> limitations. The North British is a
                            very large railway and has many branches; more than 700 miles aggregate
                            length, and an authorised share and loan capital of more than
                            £22,000,150. Like so many railways in England, the North British has
                            always been before Parl<ex>iament</ex>, in a series of contests with the

                            have been procured by <hi rendition="#u">„manipulation“</hi>. The <hi rendition="#u">accountant is examined</hi>:</p>
            <p>„You have stated that from your examination of the revenue accounts <hi rendition="#u">of Jan. 1865</hi>, you found that the revenue was
                            some <hi rendition="#u">£36,000 deficient to pay your preference
                                dividends</hi>? – Yes. – Did you report that to <hi rendition="#u">Mr. Hodgson</hi> (the chairman of directors) or to Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Rowbotham</hi> (general manager)? Yes. – <hi rendition="#u">Before the January accounts were published?</hi> –
                            Yes, I required instructions what to do. … I was told the dividend must
                            be paid under any circumstances. That day or a day or 2 afterwards, I
                            was told to bring out a dividend of 2<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi>% that half year. (these instructions given
                            by Mr. Hodgson.) – How did you do that? By making these cross-entries?
                            Yes. – Mr. Rowbotham confirmed this. He was „cognizant <hi rendition="#u">of the irregularities in the accounts</hi>, and that
                                <hi rendition="#u">dividends were declared and paid</hi> which had
                            not been earned; but that he did not order or instruct the operations by
                            which the balance-sheets were to show results unwarranted by the
                            position of the co, and that the instructions on that point <hi rendition="#u">emanated directly from the chairman to the
                                accountant</hi>. He also stated that, although he is the <hi rendition="#u">recognised medium of communication between the board
                                and the department of accounts and audit</hi>, he did not convey <pb n="107"/> to any member of the board his knowledge of the
                            irregularities.“ Herr Hodgson in seiner published defence, in reply to
                            the Investig<ex>ation</ex> Com<ex>mittee</ex>, says: „it would
                            manifestly have been impossible to obtain or maintain the value of the

                            as equivalent to a lease, but let any farmer holding his farm under such
                            terms try it. Let him quarrel with the game keeper –, let him interfere
                            with the game bred on his farm and fed on his crops for his landlord’s

                                part, <hi rendition="#u">whenever I fix farm rentals</hi> I put from
                                5 to 7s. 6d. per acre more upon land of medium quality farmed under
                                the security of a lease than if occupied on the system of annual
                                tenancy. But this additional rental is a mere tithe of the value
                                that landlords obtain by granting leases. Farming under the lease
                                system is progressive, and from the large tenant outlay which the
                                security of a lease induces,</hi> it is no unfrequent occurrence for
                            farms during a 19 years’ lease <hi rendition="#u">to be doubled in value
                                without any outlay on the part of landlords</hi>. Indeed, what are
                            usually termed landlord’s improvements on a farm let an annual tenure
                            become tenant’s improvements on farms let on lease. Tenant’s outlay
                            under the former system is too often limited to what one year will
                            exhaust, while under the latter it embraces improvements which are <hi rendition="#u">recovered by periodical returns after a lapse of
                                time</hi>. Taking into account the increased and increasing outlay
                            in the shape of labour, manure and implements which land requires to
                            make it remunerative, I consider the question of security of tenure no
                            longer doubtful, and <hi rendition="#u">that farm leases are essential

                            well rubbish. Even on the showing of the old partners, an immense part
                            of their private property must be sold. This is what happened. The sale
                            of the old partners’ property attracted attention, showed the nature of
                            the old business, and so ruined the whole firm … The shareholders haben
                            vielleicht a remedy against the directors of the limited Co. for

                            resistance to their creditors. They must pay their debts, however they

                            weights and measures; and the worst part of the case is that the same

                            cheating of this kind does not carry with it any heavy stigma among the
                            class they belong to, and also that the fines are so insufficient as to
                            afford no protection to the public. The same disgraceful state of things
                            prevails more or less all over the country. <hi rendition="#u">The

            <p>An unsavoury Congress on this subject at Leamington.</p>
            <p>The chief systems advocated were the <hi rendition="#u">earth closet system</hi>, the
                    <hi rendition="#u">system of irrigation,</hi> and the
                <hi rendition="#u">system of deodorising sewage</hi> either by
                acid, sulphate of lime, or other chemical agents.</p>
            <p>Die Croydon experiments (irrigation) schon früher erwähnt. <hi rendition="#u">Gesundheit:</hi> 1849, says Dr. Carpenter, before sewered, Croydon
                            sehr unhealthy. Deathrate 1 : 36 <hi rendition="#u">(27.7 in
                            1,000</hi>), while that of the surrounding country was 1 in 58. The
                            Population of Croydon was then 19,000, the number of inhabited houses,
                            3060 u. the rateable value of the parish 70,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> Population jezt 40,000, rateable value almost 200,000 u.
                            deathrate sunk to 19.5 in the 1000. All this owing to the introduction
                            of good water supply with sewage and thorough drainage, while the
                            irrigation of meadows with sewage has raised the value of land and
                            diminished the amount of sickness … before it is passed on the land the
                            sewage is drained of the solid parts, which are afterwards used
                            separately. Liquid manure has an advantage over solid manure as being
                            food for the plants at once, while solid manure needs time and the
                            agency of water. The result of irrigating a field of rye grass was that
                                <hi rendition="#u">6 crops</hi> taken from it in one year, the total
                            height of them being 187 inches. The grass was sown in the early part of
                            November, and it was 6 inches in height by Christmas. Before sewage was
                            applied to the claysoil the land was not worth 1£ per acre; the present
                            tenant is willing to give 16£ per acre for land and sewage. The <hi rendition="#mMM">grass of the irrigated land is preferred by cattle
                                to any other grass, and keeps the cattle in better milk and</hi>
                            better condition than other grasses. … But any <hi rendition="#u">mismanagement</hi> of the <hi rendition="#u">drainage works</hi>
                            would be a fruitful source of disease. If the sewers are not properly
                            ventilated bad gases escape into the houses, and if any sinks are left
                            untrapped the consequences may be fatal. The Croydon experiments are of
                            great value to the <hi rendition="#u">towns too large</hi> for the earth
                            closets.</p>
            <p>In <hi rendition="#u">Manchester</hi> the system of taking away the refuse without
                            entering the sewers is tried, but the removal of refuse costs a good
                            deal more than the sale of its produces. It was found, too, at
                            Aldershott, that though the surrounding soil was about the poorest in
                            the Kingdom, no one would take the camp refuse even gratuitously, and
                            the removal of it cost the War Office <choice>

                            whenever the refuse has been applied to land, have borne out this

                            <hi rendition="#u">wages</hi> would be reduced 10%, giving as their
                            reasons for the step, 1) that the price of manufactured iron had not
                            risen by any means so rapidly as the wages of the workmen engaged in
                            producing it, 2) <hi rendition="#u">that the accumulation of stocks</hi>
                            and the <hi rendition="#u">scarcity of orders</hi> rendered the
                            reduction unavoidable, and that 3) the increasing competition of
                            Germany, Belgium and France, compelled the manufacturers of this country
                            to economise the cost of production. Most of the workmen on the 3 rivers
                            belong to the <hi rendition="#u">Northern Ironworkers Union</hi>, and
                            with very little hesitation its leaders declared that the 10% reduction
                            could not be accepted. Work therefore ceased almost entirely about the
                            middle of July, and perhaps between <choice>

                            </choice>, or 30,000 men, skilled and unskilled, became idle. Besides
                            the <hi rendition="#u">Northern Union</hi>, there is a <hi rendition="#u">Southern Union</hi>, comprising the districts,
                            represented by Staffordshire. The strike did not extend to the <hi rendition="#u">Midland</hi> or <hi rendition="#u">South Wales</hi>
                            districts … At the outset the Union professed to be able to distribute
                            10s. a week to the skilled men on strike, but not more than 1 or 2
                            weekly subsidies at this rate were actually provided. The payments fell
                            to 4s., 2s. 6d, 1s., and even 6d., and during several weeks there were
                            no payments of any kind. In October an attempt was made to amalgamate
                            the Northern with the Southern Union, but it led to nothing. The appeals
                            also for assistance to other trades produced only trifling sums.</p>
            <p>The protraction of the strike, and <hi rendition="#u">the almost entire absence for
                                demand</hi>, led the masters to raise further points of controversy.
                            10% Abschlag on the puddlers’ wages; aber: the mill men, who work in
                            gangs, ought to submit to a larger reduction, especially in work where,
                            by great outlay of capital, <hi rendition="#u">rolling machinery of the
                                best and most powerful</hi> kind had been provided. The mill men
                            were paid by a given rate on the quantity of iron rolled and furnished,
                            each pair of rollers being manned by a gang or set, working under a sort
                            of sub-contractor, who alone dealt directly m<ex>it</ex> d<ex>em</ex>
                            employer. Suppose, therefore, a mill of the latest and best kind, to be
                            capable of rolling 100 tons a day at say 2.s. a ton, the payment to the
                            middleman or subcontractor, for himself and his set, would be 10<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> But if the mill were of old and inferior
                            construction, the produce would be only say 50 tons a day, which at 2s.
                            would only yield 5<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, or half of the result in

            <p>An English <hi rendition="#u">entail</hi> does not last, on an average, more than
                            about 30 years, once in a generation the entail is usually cut off, and
                            the estates resettled. Most deeds of entail contain powers to grant long
                            leases, to sell for special purposes and to exchange. By far the greater
                            part of the land in England including some of the largest estates is <hi rendition="#u">not</hi> entailed. Estates are <pb n="114"/><hi rendition="#mMM">constantly sold in England entire, although, if a
                                strong desire existed to obtain small portions of them for
                                cultivation, and a higher price could thus be realised for them,
                                they would infallibly be divided as we see to happen when a demand
                                exists for land for building or accommodation purposes, owing to
                                some peculiarities of situation. On the whole then it appears
                                certain that although the effect of entails in preventing the
                                division of estates is doubtless considerable, yet it is much less
                                than is commonly supposed, and will not account for the phenomena
                                before us. The <hi rendition="#u">number of small farmers</hi>
                                occupying the land of others for agricultural purposes has

                            workpeople. Diese works employ about 120 men, when in full activity. The
                            principles:</p>
            <p>1) To pay to all the men the full ordinary wages of the district for the several
                            kinds of work, and for the number of hours usual in the district. 2) To
                            prohibit any workman from belonging to any Trades <choice>

                            </choice>, and so long as he is employed at Newport. 3) fhe firm to have
                            a first lien on the net profits of each year to <hi rendition="#u">the
                                extent of 10%</hi> p. a. as compensation for interest and risk of
                            capital. 4) The surplus of net profits (if any) beyond 10% per annum to
                            be divided equally between the firm and the workman – the payment to the
                            workmen being calculated as an uniform percentage on the amount of
                            actual earnings of each during the year, in order that the bonus to each
                            man may be determined by his own skill etc. The bonus to be paid to
                            workmen who may have worked for the firm even for part only of the year.
                            5) Arrangements to be made under the
                            <?oxy_comment_start author="grassmann" timestamp="20190611T172448+0200" comment="LR"?>Amended
                            Partnership Act of 1865<?oxy_comment_end?> for enabling the men to

                            profits. 6) The full and absolute control of the business to remain with
                            the firm; and the certificate of a public accountant to be final, and
                            without appeal, as regards the profits and distributions of each

                            circumstances. In his view land does not pay. If he is to let it to a
                            farmer, he cannot expect a return at the best of more than 3%, and if he
                            is to cultivate it himself, he will have to furnish additional money,
                            with great chance of getting no return at all. Under this persuasion he
                            puts his savings in funds, railway shares, bonds, or mortgages
                                etc<supplied cert="high">.</supplied> Daher is so little competition
                            for moderate quantities of land, farmes of 100 to 200 acres, only fit
                            for cultivation. Wenn for building purposes etc, the small capitalist
                            becomes an eager purchaser. Daher auch <hi rendition="#u">constant

                            be declined. The free holder of 20 acres, who has supported himself and
                            family in a state of great penury, by farming it himself, is offered for

                            owns a farm of 100 acres, and has a capital besides of, say £1000
                            employed in its cultivation. His total income can hardly exceed 300<hi rendition="#u">l.</hi> p. annum, 150<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> for

                            his position if he sells his farm for from 4,500 to 5000<hi rendition="#u">l.</hi>, and withdraws the floating capital. He will

            <p>A poor man who is accused of an offence cannot employ the same counsel, cannot have
                            the same facilities of collecting evidence, cannot have his case put
                            before the court as a rich man could. For these very reasons the law
                            ought to favour the poor rather than the rich. It ought not to presume
                            on the necessary disadvantages of a man’s position to impose fresh
                            burdens upon him. It has done in the case of master and servant. It has
                            widened the gulf between capital and labour by attempting to give
                            capital the command over labour. It has viewed the relation between the
                            employer and the employed as if the first entered into a light civil
                            contract, while the second bound himself by a penal bond. It has given
                            the first a summary mode of redress, while it has thrown the second on
                            his own resources. Summary punishments are the most effectual. Penalties
                            which must be levied by civil process are comparatively seldom exacted,

                            taken, mostly in handcuffs, before the magistrate. By the English system
                            of criminal procedure, he cannot be heard in his own defence. The
                            magistrate who tries him is generally a master. The law gives, besides,
                            the magistrate <hi rendition="#u">no option</hi>. If the master presses
                            for a conviction he is entitled to have it, and we read of a case in
                            Scotland where a master refused to take a man back but insisted on his
                            being imprisoned. The man pretended that the master had virtually broken
                            the contract by putting him to work which he was not legally bound to
                            do. This case does not stand alone. In the blue book … an instance of
                            men being refused their wages on the usual pay-day, and yet being
                            compelled to work by criminal proceedings. We have a peculiar case of
                            men being discharged for refusing to work night and day, being then
                            apprehended under a warrant, and, on an acquittal, being unable to
                            recover damages either for their discharge or their false imprisonment.
                            In some trades the master may discharge on month’s notice, but the
                            servant who leaves on a month’s notice, may be sent to prison. At
                            certain steel works, „when a man is engaged, he is supplied with a code
                            of rules, the notice to leave being 7 or 14 days’ notice.“ But the
                            manager, instead of giving this notice to the men, „posts a notice on
                            the wall to say that all those who belong to Unions are to leave at a
                            certain date. The men want the same notice as he would require.“ In the
                            Wolverhampton district it is the custom to enter into contract <hi rendition="#u">for a year</hi>, and the contract stipulates that the
                            master may discharge his workmen at a month’s notice, but that the
                            workmen must give 6 month’s notice. „A workman binds himself for
                            12 months to his employer“, says a witness from the Potteries, „and the
                            employer undertakes to find him work for that period; but when the
                            workmen sought to force from the employer the full amount of work, he
                            never could obtain it, and the master could force from the workmen his
                            12 months’ employment.“ <hi rendition="#mMM">When the men know that
                                there are <hi rendition="#u">some 10 000 prosecutors annually under
                                    the Master and the Servant Act</hi>, when they think that the
                                magistrates before whom those cases are tried are mostly employers,
                                when they see the justice of peace and the employer conferring in an
                                ale house together before the trial, and returning to the ale house
                                together after the trial, they may be excused for combining against
                                their masters and the law which supports their masters.</hi></p>

            <p>Leicetershire is the land of the grazier; its grass land is the great source of its

                            of our meat supply.</p>
            <p>The climate being mild and equable, the rainfall moderate though usually sufficient,
                            and there being <hi rendition="#u">no bogs or mountains</hi>, the
                            Leicestershire farmer occupies a position more favourable than the
                            average of the Engl. counties. The <hi rendition="#u">Eastern
                                division</hi> contains the greater portion of the rich grazing land
                            – consisting mainly of clay loams – varying from stiff to friable. Many
                            of the farms in this division have <hi rendition="#u">no arable
                                land</hi>, others having from <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">6</hi> to <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> in arable. <hi rendition="#u">Dairying</hi>
                            is pursued chiefly <hi rendition="#u">on the small farms in the northern
                                portion</hi>, while the great bulk of this division <hi rendition="#mMM">is used for <hi rendition="#u">fattening cattle and
                                    sheep</hi>. It is to the natural richness of the pastures
                                „rather than to any extraordinary pains bestowed on their
                                improvement that Leicestershire is indebted for her surpassing
                                fertility“. <hi rendition="#u">The rents received by the landowners
                                    are the highest of any county</hi></hi>
                            <hi rendition="#u">in the kingdom</hi>. Though within the last 20 years
                            – since Repeal of the corn laws – much draining has been done, much land
                            yet requires that first and preliminary improvement.</p>
            <p>Farms range from 50 to 800 acres, the more general sizes being from 100 to 300. There
                            are, however, <hi rendition="#u">many small holdings ranging from 20 to
                                70 acres</hi>. The smaller farms are usually occupied by dairy
                            farmers, as their chief product is the well known <hi rendition="#u">Stilton Cheese</hi>. Trees u. hedge rows bilden a serious
                            incumbrance of the land. The <hi rendition="#u">grazing farms are nearly
                                devoid of farm-buildings</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Yet these farms
                                let at 3<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> and upwards per acre.</hi> Such
                            land will „fatten a bullock, weighing when fat from 50 to 60 imperial
                            stones, and one sheep over 20 lbs per quarter, during the summer months,
                            and in winter will keep from 1 to 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> sheep per acre. Freedom from the care and
                            complexity of arable cultivation, renders these purely grazing farms
                            attractive. Yet they require much attention to render them profitable.
                            Care must be taken to prevent the grass getting too long, and yet the
                            pasture must never be bare, or rapid fattening becomes impossible.
                            Consequently cattle in certain seasons must be bought at whatever cost;
                            and, again, when grass falls short, some of them must be sold even at a
                            disadvantage, or the grass must be supplemented by a liberal use of
                            cake. Once a year the pasture must be grazed bare, or the rough places
                            mown with the scythe. The more general practice to „crop them off during
                            the winter months with Scotch or Welsh runts, termed <hi rendition="#u">„gnawers“</hi>. All this requires watchful attention to keep the
                            pastures sweet and level, and yet have the cattle, including the <hi rendition="#u">gnawers</hi> in an improving state. The droppings of
                            the cattle are also collected before they have time to rot the grass and
                            ultimately to produce rough herbage which nothing will eat.</p>
            <p>Meadows, from which hay is taken, are grazed and mown alternately. Here there is
                            great room for improvement, as very little dressing beyond ditch

                                „About Burrow, and from thence north, some of the pastures are in a

                                ant-hills, to the entire exclusion of all good and nutritious
                                herbage. Drainage is much wanted. Thistles and other noxious weeds
                                abound, and the care and attention bestowed on the grass land in the

            <p>In the <hi rendition="#u">Western Division of the County</hi> there is a good deal of
                            friable and some heavy arable land. „Seit d<ex>en</ex> letzten

                            remains much land that loudly calls for drainage. There are 1000 of
                            acres of secondrate quality which liberal and judicious manuring would
                            convert into pastures of fair fattening quality. There are 100<hi rendition="#sup">ds</hi> of acres so covered with ant-hills as to be
                            almost worthless. On some farms, hassocks, thistles etc are allowed to

            <p>It would scarcely be possible for any inquiry to show how often the mere existence of
                            Unions have caused masters to raise wages without a strike, or even a
                            quarrel; how often the same fact has prevented them from lowering wages
                            where they would otherwise have been glad of the opportunity; and it is
                            in their <hi rendition="#u">silent</hi> exercises of influence that
                            trade combinations have no doubt effected their greatest benefit. You
                            could discover by investigation, how often overexercise has caused
                            illness; but not practicable to make out, by an investigation, how often
                            moderate exercise has prevented it. Unions, which put the labourers to
                            some extent in the condition of a capitalist, must improve the terms
                            they obtain from capitalists. This power is so great as often to be

            <p>The dyers of Lyons and St. Etienne have addressed a petition to the minister of
                            Commerce, for a modification in the duties on alcohol, so far as
                            concerns the dyeing trade. The preparation of the colours derived from
                            aneline, „which“, they say, „tends to nothing less <hi rendition="#u">than to dethrone vegetable colours</hi>“, necessitates the <hi rendition="#u">employment of alcohol</hi>; but the Gvt requires the
                            alcohol so used to be „denaturalised“ by the addition of 20% of coal
                            tar, so as to prevent it from being turned to other purpose. This
                            denaturalisation spoils its quality, hence <hi rendition="#u">Swiss</hi>
                            dyers, able to use pure alcohols, are beating the French in the quality
                            of their dyes. The French Alcohol too, though spoiled by the said
                            addition, is taxed heavily, where that of the Swiss pays nothing;
                            consequently, <hi rendition="#u">in price</hi> also, the Swiss defeat
                            them. Whilst in France a kilogramme of light blue costs 445f., it only
                            costs in Switzerland 205f. Nearly one half of the silks of Lyons and
                            St. Etienne are now dyed by aneline.</p>

            <p>To prevent the „bear“ operations on the stock exchange in Bank shares. At the time,
                            when credit was much disturbed, speculators sold, for future delivery,
                            shares in banks on a large scale, which they did not possess – they then
                            propagated bad rumours as to these banks – thus depressed the prices of
                            the shares – they then gained the difference between the comparatively
                            high price at which they sold the shares when the bank credit was good,
                            and the comparatively low price at which they bought, when partly by
                            their own machinations the bankcredit had become bad. Often great
                            profits in this way gained last year. On the shares which, like those of
                            the Agra and Masterman’s bank, went forth at a high premium, and then,
                            by the failure of the bank, fell to be worth less than nothing, the
                            differences were often very large. The dealers in bank shares gained by
                                <hi rendition="#u">the destruction</hi> of the whole bank, and
                            intended so to gain. Leeman’s bill checks this practice by providing,
                            that no man shall sell bank shares which he has not got, and requiring,
                            as a guarantee of his having them, that he shall state their „numbers“
                            in the register when he sells. Nobody could then sell bank shares which
                            he hoped to buy in the market, because he would never know that he could
                            get hold of the particular shares his sale not mentioned … The price of
                            bankshares is, now that the blot is hit and the danger known, <hi rendition="#u">more</hi> depressed by its being known that this kind
                            of property is subject to annihilation by well planned machinations than
                            it would be depressed by the exclusion of bankshares from the
                            speculative market.</p>

                            1848 fail to show the real change, as they do not show what the natural
                            increase would have been. Nevertheless, agricultural wages throughout
                            the greater part of Ireland are still <hi rendition="#u">under 6sh. a
                                week</hi>, deducting Sundays and holidays; in America the rate is
                            7 dollars a week, and even more in the Eastern states. Where skilled
                            labour (in Ireland) dearest, it is so only because it is so only seldom
                            employed, and hardly to be had. The price of common labour, on the other
                            hand, it still below a shilling a day throughout the year; having risen
                            in some counties from 8 to 9d. for a day’s work to a shilling, with more
                            constant employment it is true. A rise to this extent, it is very clear,
                            will not stop emigration. … It is material to observe, that these
                            additions ⦗v<ex>on</ex> food etc zu money wages⦘ are most common, and on
                            the most liberal scale, where emigration has <hi rendition="#u">not</hi>
                            reduced the number of the labouring population; and, in the second
                            place, that while such allowances are far from being general throughout
                            the island, a great <hi rendition="#u">rise <hi rendition="#uu">of
                                    prices</hi></hi> must be set off against the <hi rendition="#u">rise in money wages</hi>. In <hi rendition="#u">1848</hi>, the cost
                            of the Irish constabulary was estimated at 35<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>
                            2s. 6d. a man; <hi rendition="#u">1866</hi> the Commission rated it at
                                51<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> 16s. 4d.; a rise of nearly 50%, and
                            prices have risen since then. In many parts of Ireland, the labourer
                            earns 6sh. a week, where his father, or he himself in his youth, earned
                            only 4; but potatoes were then at 2d. a stone, where they are now above
                            4d; meat was 3d. a pound, where now it is 7d. or more; the labourer’s
                            clothing 10 years ago was from 50 to 100% cheaper than now; and his
                            whiskey was both cheaper and better. His tea alone is considerably
                            cheaper. He can, indeed, now live upon Indian meal, but his diet on that
                            costs a good deal more than it formerly did on potatoes, and he does not
                            like it so well. What is more to the point, he would not have to live
                            upon Indian meal in America. Were it not for remittances from friends in
                            America, it is certain that a great number of the peasants would be
                            little better off than before the famine; I know cases in <hi rendition="#u">several counties where a labour is positively worse
                                off</hi> than he was then; that is to say, he earns now just what he
                            did then – a shilling a day; for his employer can give no more on
                            account of the scarcity of labour or the dearness of food. … It has been
                            suggested that increased payments for labour may be met on the part of
                            producers by increased charges on commodities, and that a higher cost of
                            production must result in higher prices for the articles produced.
                            Erstens <hi rendition="#u">Foreign Competition</hi> checkes this, und:
                            The limit to expenditure is fixed by the means of the buyer, not by the
                            needs of the seller; and consumers are not enabled to pay more for
                            commodities by having to pay more for services. In the case of
                            commodities, as in that of labour, the <hi rendition="#u">equation of
                                demand and supply at a higher price</hi> involves, if other things
                            are unaltered, <hi rendition="#u">a diminution of both demand and

                            proposes, in the interest of public health and working men’s comfort, to
                            enable any magistrate, or municipal council, or vestry, or other local
                            authority with jurisdiction, to compel the landlord to abate the
                            nuisance. The owner of any house, or group of houses, unfit for human
                            habitation may, on a report of the health officer condemning such
                            houses, be summoned before the Grand Jury to explain their condition. If
                            he fails to do so, the Grand Jury may issue an order for the completion
                            of any necessary works, even if they involve the total destruction of
                            the buildings, and on this order the „local authority<supplied cert="high">“</supplied> must act. They will order the owner to
                            perform the work, and if he declines or delays, they may tender to him
                            the value of the premises, and <hi rendition="#u">enter into possession
                                of them themselves.</hi> When so entered, <hi rendition="#u">they

                            out of the receipts from the new buildings, or out of a local rate. The
                            local authority is not, however, to keep the buildings, but to sell them
                            within 7 years. The purpose of the Act is, to enable any municipality,
                            or authority like the Metrop<ex>olitan</ex> Board of Works, to <hi rendition="#u">take</hi> at a valuation the „rookeries“ in great
                            cities, and either clear them away or cover them with habitable
                            dwellings for the poor. … Land in town is limited in quantity – that is,
                            houses too far from business centres are useless to relieve those
                            centres. … The demand may exist, indeed, does exist; but supply is not
                            afforded, because there is no unoccupied space on which to build … There
                            remains … <hi rendition="#u">only force</hi>, and this is applied in the
                            gentlest manner, the landlord not being compelled to sell unless he
                            refuses to protect the public health and morals in the way required of
                            him, and when compelled, receiving the full money value of his property.
                                … <hi rendition="#mMM">For the rest, the Bill, as it stands, is only

            <p>In d<ex>em</ex> Report u<ex>nd</ex> in Evidence (inspection of) v<ex>on</ex> McKay,
                            dessen „once famous shipyard was entirely deserted“. Er sagt: „There was
                            no sale for American vessels other than the <hi rendition="#u">small
                                craft employed in the coasting trade</hi>. First-class ships he
                            formerly built and equipped ready for sea for from 65 dollars to 70 dls
                            per ton; now the same vessels would cost 110 dls p. ton; an investment
                            which would afford no profit to the merchants who employed such vessels.
                            The merchants could do better by investing in Gvt. Securities, which
                            yield 6% in gold, on currency investments, and which are exempted from
                            taxation. In the Brit<ex>ish</ex> provinces, the same class of vessels
                            can now be built and equipped ready for sea for 40 dls to 50 dls gold
                            per ton – about half. And this, too, after buying the oak timber in
                            Maryland. If this state of affairs continues a few years longer, the
                            nation would not own a vessel which could be used as a war transport in
                            the event of war. All our cotton-carrying is done by foreign vessels.
                            Our tonnage statistics for the main part comprise vessels engaged in
                            coasting and inland navigation; very few sea-going ships. <hi rendition="#u">Ship-building</hi> at a standstill … The year <hi rendition="#u">1854-5</hi> was the best year of active shipbuilding
                            in the U. States. From <hi rendition="#u">1856</hi>, it declined
                            somewhat during 1857, 1858, and 1859. Then it went up again, until 1861
                            it touched almost as high a point as in 1854–55. During 1862, it
                            declined again, but not so much as it had during 1857, 1858, and 1859.
                            In 1863, it recovered its former level once more, but soon afterwards
                            sunk down much lower than it sunk in 1857 u<ex>nd</ex> 1859, and now in
                            1866 it was almost at an end.“ As a consequence the <hi rendition="#u">trade of America</hi> is beginning to be carried on in <hi rendition="#u">non-American ships</hi>.</p>

                            Ein Hauptgrund <hi rendition="#mMM">ist d<ex>ie</ex> unequal taxation,
                                die 6% tax upon all the manufactured products of the country. It
                                favours simple industries, and falls heavily on <hi rendition="#u">compound</hi> industries. A <hi rendition="#u">ship</hi> is a
                                far more composite article than an umbrella. The frame of the ship
                                may be cut out and put together in the building yard; but the iron,
                                the yellow metal, the masts, the sails, the spars, the cordage, and
                                much else must all be bought elsewhere; it is what American might
                                call <hi rendition="#u">„an assembled article“</hi>. And upon every
                                item so collected, <hi rendition="#u">two</hi> taxes, at least, are
                                paid, one by the seller of whom the shipper buys, and another by the
                                shipbuilder himself.</hi> The new taxation of America has,
                            therefore, a most sure tendency to drive capital from a complex
                            manufacture like shipbuilding to simple manufactures which are only
                            charged once, and agriculture which is not charged at all. … In <hi rendition="#u">shipbuilding</hi>, America has only an advantage, <hi rendition="#u">cheap timber</hi>, and with the daily progress of <hi rendition="#u">iron shipbuilding</hi>, <pb n="127"/> this advantage

                            (wenn auch nicht to the same degree as in U. St.) throughout the world.
                                <hi rendition="#u">Shipowning</hi> is a trade in which a slight
                            excess of supply produces a great depression of price. When a ship, with
                            a crew on board, arrives in Bombay harbour, she must take what freight
                            she can get; she cannot stay there, as the saying is, „eating her head
                            off“, till freights get better. Accordingly, as soon as a greater number
                            of ships come into port than there are pressing goods for, freights
                            rapidly go down, and with them the profits of shipowning. If, on the
                            other hand, there are but few ships in port, and there is an
                            accumulation of goods on the wharf which the owners went to send on at
                            once to a very profitable, but not, perhaps, very steady and lasting
                            market, freights rise with wonderful rapidity, and then the ship owner
                            gains enough to repay him for other seasons of bad demand and
                            depression. <hi rendition="#u">Shipbuilding</hi> is a trade intended to
                            supply shipowners with ships, and as the profits of the latter are
                            intermittent, so also is their demand for new ships.</p>

            <p>The Unions secure considerable advantages to the main body of workmen in each trade,
                            they distinctly injure the best workmen in each trade, they diminish in
                            all trades the incentives to rapid and general progress. That <hi rendition="#u">they tend to raise the average level of wages, by
                                depriving the master of his main instrument, the fear of
                            hunger</hi>, is beyond question, and is indeed unquestioned, because,
                                <hi rendition="#u">if they did not, masters would have very little
                                reason to bestir themselves in the matter</hi>. They would not be
                            displeased with a <hi rendition="#u">strike to lower wages</hi>, if such
                            a thing could occur. Up to certain point this process is beneficial, as
                                <hi rendition="#u">without some resistance of some kind the tendency
                                of employers would be to lower wages to the limit below which life
                                could not be preserved, a point actually reached in some kind of
                                agricultural work</hi>. It seems, also, clear that the Unions always
                            diminish the number of minor strikes … And lastly the <hi rendition="#u">effect of the Union has been to substitute moral force, social
                                compulsion</hi> for <hi rendition="#u">physical force</hi>,
                            compulsion by the pike, and vitriol throwing and fire raising. A strike
                            ordered by a Union is a very bad thing; but it is a better thing than an
                            organisation like that of the Luddites, which years ago kept
                            Nottinghamshire in terror. On the other hand, the Unions crush down
                            special power, activity, and originality in workmen.</p>
            <p>We do not see, f. e. how under the Union theory, any general progress is to be made
                            in trade at all. The Union decrees, it may be quite justly, that to lay,
                            say 100 bricks an hour, is good average work. But if the best men were
                            tempted by the free enjoyment of their faculties to do all they could,
                            they might bring up the standard to 200 bricks, and <hi rendition="#u">devise appliances</hi>

            <p>At present, the Union men are subject, at all events, to emulation and competition
                            from non-Union men, but the Executives try to attract <hi rendition="#u">all</hi> of a particular trade, by steady discouragement to
                            outsiders.</p>
            <p>The single thing to prevent is intimidation, whether physical, or, if we can reach
                            it, moral. So far from making Unions, or rather leaving Unions illegal
                            corporations, we would give them every opportunity of <hi rendition="#u">legalising</hi> themselves, insisting only that their rules shall
                            be public, and that every member shall be free to depart without fine or
                            other punishment. At present, he loses all back payments.</p>
            <p>The ablest men would form new and smaller Unions of picked men. Jobs would be
                            undertaken by Associations, which would be, in fact, Competitive Unions.
                            By refusing to recognise the Unions, we shall not extinguish them; but
                            we shall turn them into <hi rendition="#u">illegal combinations</hi>
                            with written, instead of printed laws, and a secret and, therefore,
                            oppressive, system of punishment for secession. That was the direct
                            effect of the laws against combinations, and it would be also in a less
                            degree the effect of placing or leaving them outside the law.</p>
            <p>There is <hi rendition="#u">not a State in the world</hi> which, <hi rendition="#u">deprived of the power of coercion</hi>, would not go to pieces, and
                            if we can but destroy that, and we can, <hi rendition="#u">the Unions
                                will divide</hi>. Allow new combinations to start easily, and they
                            will be numerous enough, and competitive enough, to keep up the natural
                            progress of society. Persecute a sect and it holds together, legalise it
                            and it splits and resplits, till its unity is either <hi rendition="#u">null</hi> or in non-oppressive bond.</p>

                            are filled with idle dealers, the shops with idle clerks, the streets
                            with idle mechanics. The spring business is already over. The people are
                            wearing their old clothes, drawing on the savings’ banks, and giving
                            another turn to the economical screw. Rents and provisions are
                            enormously high; and although dress goods are cheaper than at the same
                            time last year, the people have no inclination to buy. … The newspaper
                            proprietors, with one exception, are drawing on their capital. The
                            business of the railway Cos. is much smaller than at the corresponding
                            period 1866. The Woollen and Cotton mills are running upon short time,
                            and some of them will soon suspend work altogether. And the clamour of
                            the Gold Room and the Stock exchanges are more furious than ever.
                            Während d<ex>es</ex> war all seemed to thrive. And then came Petrolium,

            <p>The prices of Stock Exchange securities, and the range of dealings in them, were kept
                            up by the appearance of continual fresh bodies of purchasers, who
                            brought into that market capital taken and <hi rendition="#u">to be

                            period of bold, sanguine, and experimental outlay. It was also <hi rendition="#u">a period of ostentatious expenditure</hi>. Large
                            numbers of people seemed to get rich all at once, and, of course, they

                            their fortunes. The panic of May, 1866, brought to a sudden end all this
                            artificial prosperity. Ausserdem kam politische Unruhe, German War,
                            Fenians, Cattle Plague, Cholera, dismal and rainy weather. The <hi rendition="#u">disorganisation of the India trade</hi> has extended

            <p>It is quite certain that there has scarcely been any period when debts were so
                            difficult to collect, and when the usual bills drawn by wholesale

                            payment. The draper and grocer sells less because his customer have to
                            meet the calls of some Railway, Banking, Finance, or Trade Co., either
                            in or just out of the Court of Chancery, and hence are compelled to live

                                large, and the working men are too little of a distinct class, and
                                are largely divided by difference of origin and religion into too

                                at this moment more general than they have ever been and there is no
                                immediate prospect of heir termination.</hi> The 8 hour law, passed
                            by the <hi rendition="#u">Illinois Legislature last winter</hi>, and
                            which has just gone into operation, has thrown the large towns in the
                            State into commotion, and given the <hi rendition="#u">Striking Mania in
                                the West</hi> a violence which it does not display in this part of
                            the world. Absurd this 8 Hours’ Agitation. It was begun by some of the
                            better class of the workmen, believing in its salutary effects on the
                            moral and physical condition of the labourers. <hi rendition="#u">Owing
                                to the enormous profits which the manufacturers were making 2 years
                                ago</hi>, the economical objections to the scheme made little
                            impression on the agitators. They denied that a reduction in the hours
                            of labour would materially diminish production, and maintained that even
                            if it did <hi rendition="#u">it ought not to cause a restriction in
                                wages, as long as capitalists were making, as many of them were,
                                100%</hi>. All that would happen, if <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> were taken off the working hours, would be
                                <hi rendition="#u">that the enormous gains of the employers</hi>
                            would be slightly diminished, while the condition of the whole working
                            class would be greatly improved. The argument drawn from <hi rendition="#u">these large profits</hi> has of course since lost all
                            its force. They have disappeared. The reduction of <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> labour would be = reduction of
                                <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">5</hi> production,
                                u<ex>nd</ex> daher <hi rendition="#u">an increase of prices</hi>.
                            But, unfortunately, by the time this demonstration of the absurdity of
                            the movement was ready, the <hi rendition="#u">rank and file of the
                                Irish</hi>, and other foreigners, ignorant and bigoted, had entered

                            on without rhyme or reason, until it has at last got an act passed in
                            Illinois, and has come near doing so in Pennsylvania and some other
                            States.“</p><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/>

                            in 1863 (25. March), the Banking Institutions of the Union had been
                            regulated in each State by the State Legislature; considerable
                            variations between one State and the other. In all the States there were
                            regulations, more or less stringent, regarding the <hi rendition="#u">Deposit of State and Federal Bonds as a Guarantee for Note

                            considered indispensable. There was a period when the State Comptroller
                            professed to satisfy himself, by a personal visit to each Bank on
                            certain days, that it had in its own actual possession the prescribed
                            amount of specie and public securities. But it was soon discovered that
                            by ingenious arrangements, the <hi rendition="#u">same</hi> parcel of
                            specie and securities was made to travel through a series of banks –
                            being of course, borrowed for the occasion, and paid for handsomely,
                            under the appropriate title of <hi rendition="#u">„shin plaster“</hi>.
                            For <hi rendition="#u">some years prior to 1863</hi>, the American
                            public had found out that by far the best preservative against vicious
                            banking is not excessive legislation, but rigid enforcement of the
                            obligation of specie payment. There had, accordingly, been long
                            established in <hi rendition="#u">New England</hi>, a system of almost
                            daily <hi rendition="#u">Note Exchanges</hi> between all Banks carrying

                                Banks.</p>
            <p>The principles of this arrangement come to this:</p>
            <p>Ⅰ) Almost absolute control by the Federal Executive at Washington over all the
                                Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks. The Secr<ex>etary</ex> of
                            Treas<ex>ury</ex>, at his <hi rendition="#u">discretion</hi>, can
                            authorise the formation of Banks in all places of less than 6000
                            inhabitants; he can select Nat<ex>ional</ex> Bks. to be depositories of
                            public money and Federal financial agents; he can constantly interfere
                            in the affairs of each bank, by rigidly enforcing the condition that the
                            Notes furnished shall only be 90% of the <hi rendition="#u">market
                                value</hi> of the Bonds lodged; and, at his pleasure, tighten or
                            relax the power of affecting the credit of any Bank, by directing the
                            visit to it of a Special Inspector.</p>
            <p>Ⅱ) The establishment of at least <hi rendition="#u">300 mill. $ circulation of
                                    Nat<ex>ional</ex> Bk. N<hi rendition="#u">otes</hi></hi>,
                            ultimately payable by the Federal Treasury out of the proceeds of
                            Federal securities, that is, of <hi rendition="#u">300 millions of what
                                may be called Greenbacks N. 2</hi>. These Nat<ex>ional</ex> Bk.
                            Notes to be forcibly substituted (for the 10% tax on the circulation of
                            the State Banks is virtually prohibitory) for the notes of the Banks
                            previously existing under laws and constitutions adopted by the several
                            States. The 300 mill. of Nat<ex>ional</ex> Bank Notes to be apportioned
                            over the country <hi rendition="#u">virtually</hi> at the discretion of
                            the Secr<ex>etary</ex> of the Treasury.</p>
            <p>Ⅲ) The sudden and complete creation of a Federal Gvt. Banking Organisation of the
                            most absolute character, differing only from the Bank of France in the
                            circumstance that instead of creating, as in France, a large Central
                            Bank, with a monopoly of Circulation and a monopoly of Branches, and a
                            management largely nominated by the Minister, the procedure consists in
                            scattering 1600 or 1700 separate institutions over the country, but
                            placing them under the effective control of an office in Washington,
                            compelling each of them to invest <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> of their capital in Federal Securities, and
                            selecting from time to time from the most favoured Banks those which
                            shall become depositories of public money and Gvt. financial agents.

            <p>April 1,649 419,000,000 291,000,000</p>
            <p>The progress became rapid <hi rendition="#u">after Jan. 1865</hi>, when pressure
                            really put on the State Banks to conform to the new system. Prior <pb n="140"/> to April, 1865, it is probable that most of the 6 or 700
                                Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks opened were entirely new institutions. Z. B.
                            out of 152 Banks established up to Feb., 1864, not less than 46 opened
                            in small places where, up to this time, no bank had existed. It was,
                            undoubtedly, a principal feature of Chase’s scheme to <hi rendition="#u">promote the creation of New Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks in the more

                            were included, of course, legal tender notes of the Federal Gvt. In <hi rendition="#u">actual specie</hi>, the Banks in the above category
                            seem to have held about 7% of their assets. The Gvt. securities included
                                <hi rendition="#u">State Bonds</hi> as well as <hi rendition="#u">Federal Bonds</hi>. In <hi rendition="#u">Cash Reserves and Gvt.
                                Securities</hi>, the State Banks held very nearly 29.4% of their

                            other Banks, arise from a practice early adopted in all American returns
                            of distinguishing the balances between one set of banks and another, in
                            order to ascertain in some degree with what exactness the system of
                            exchanges was kept up. On the Liability side, the <hi rendition="#u">Circulation</hi> was only 11.3%, and the Capital paid up was 33.5%.
                            At the end of 1862, the State Banks had so arrived at a condition of no
                            little strength. We find from table <hi rendition="#u">C</hi>, that in
                            the 5 Middle States, including <hi rendition="#u">New York</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">Pennsylvania</hi>, the <hi rendition="#u">Circulation
                                was only 5.7% of the liabilities</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">against
                                26% in the more remote and less commercial Eastern States</hi>, and

                            (1866) last year was attributed to the <hi rendition="#u">foul state of

                                tributaries of the lower Thames</hi>. It rises in the country of

                            drains a large area of Hertfordshire. It is a tidal river for about
                            5 miles in length, and is navigable for barges a distance of 28 miles.
                            So old is this navigation of the river, that

                            In this respect the Lee presents an advantageous contrast to the Thames,
                            but the comparative rates at which the 2 rivers are drained for the
                            supply of London are out of proportion. While the Thames has a minimum
                            dry weather flow of 350 millions gallons daily over Teddington lock, and
                            supplies <hi rendition="#u">48 mill. gallons daily to 5 London water

                            but does not hold itself responsible for anything further, and as the

                            water, there <hi rendition="#u">is a continual water famine</hi>. Of
                            this, the engineer to the <hi rendition="#u">New River Co</hi> gives

                            the culpable indifference of the landlords has led to these <hi rendition="#u">exceptional privileges</hi> being granted to their

            <p>The systematic way in which the <hi rendition="#u">sewage of the towns</hi> on the
                            banks of the Lee, and <hi rendition="#u">the refuse of an agricultural
                                and industrial district are poured into the</hi> river, schlimmer
                            als d<ex>ie</ex> pollution d<ex>er</ex> Thames selbst. At <hi rendition="#u">Luton</hi>, indeed, where the Lee is „yet a slender
                            stream“, the sewage is clarified by the <hi rendition="#u">lime
                                process</hi> before passing into the river. This purification is the
                            result of legal measures taken by a landed proprietor, and, though not a
                            perfect remedy, is an improvement. As we drop down the river <hi rendition="#u">much litigation</hi> is found without any such
                            result. „We learn“, say the Commissioners, „with something approaching
                            to dismay, that one manufacturer alone employs from <hi rendition="#u">1
                                to 2 tons of oxalic acid</hi> in bleaching straw plaits, but are
                            somewhat reassured upon consideration that the poisonous character of
                            this substance is entirely destroyed by admixture with the carbonate and
                            sulphate of lime contained in the water of the river.“ Then, the river
                            is polluted by <hi rendition="#u">sheep washing</hi>, and, as the
                            preparation for dipping sheep contains <hi rendition="#u">arsenic</hi>,
                            another noxious ingredient is added to the new <hi rendition="#u">witches’ cauldron</hi>. But, besides these directly poisonous
                            substances, the river receives the <hi rendition="#u">sewage</hi> of
                            Hatfield, Hertford, Ware, Enfield, Barnet, and Tottenham. The foulness
                            of the stream after passing by all these places, or their outlets, is
                            such that the enormous volume of sewage, pumped in by West Ham, which
                            has a population of more than 22,000, makes no visible alteration. Every
                            town complains of the town next above it, and gives cause of complaint
                            to the town next below. At Luton, a perpetual injunction has been
                            obtained against the town authorities. At Hertford, the <hi rendition="#u">New River Co.</hi> is threatened by the authorities
                            of Ware. Ware itself passes on both grievance and complaint.

                            „Our neighbours at Sawbridgenorth have told us that we have been
                            poisoning them. We have said that we are sorry for it, but we think that
                            they contribute to the nuisance to some extent themselves, and we have,
                            therefore, not heeded what they had to say.“ <hi rendition="#mMM">Indeed, Bishop Stortford prides itself of having discovered a plan
                                for the utilisation of sewage, and having appeased the discontent of
                                its own inhabitants at the expense of strangers. „The nuisance of

                                was during the summers of 1864 and 1865, but it was very much abated
                                in consequence of our having wet seasons, and a plan was adopted
                                that <hi rendition="#u">succeeded remarkably well</hi>, and that was
                                this:</hi> During the summer when the water is very short, the filth
                            will sometimes almost crop up to the mouth of the drains, and when there
                            has been a flood in the winter, this accumulation has been stirred up by
                            a large and a heavy rake behind, <hi rendition="#u">so that we have
                                passed it on to our neighbours to some extent</hi>. We thought we
                            had kept it long enough, and by the use of the flood water <hi rendition="#u">relieved ourselves from a considerable quantity of
                                stink by that means</hi>.“ The Commissioners see no hope in the
                            litigation opened by Edmonton against Enfield, by Tottenham against
                            Hornsey, by the Lee Trustees against Tottenham. What the Commissioners
                            propose is a <hi rendition="#u">Conservancy Board</hi>, acting for the
                            entire watershed, and bound to provide for the cessation of the present
                            supply of sewage to the river, as well as for its general maintenance
                            and protection.</p>

                            they have originally paid away. The wide action of the Notes of
                                Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks has already reduced a large part of them to
                            a discount; and to <hi rendition="#u">remedy this discredit</hi>, the
                            Comptroller urges that all Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks shall be compelled to
                            redeem their Notes at par at New York, by means of funds maintained
                            there in the hands of correspondents – that is, of some one or more of
                            the New York Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks. Aber, says the Comptroller: „If
                            all the provincial Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks are to redeem their Notes in
                            New York, they must constantly maintain there large funds – the New York
                            Banks will compete for the custody of these funds, and the more
                            adventurous of them will bid for accounts by offering high rates of
                            interest on country deposits. But if the New York Banks give high rates
                            of interest for money left with them, they can only make a profit by
                            advances more or less hazardous, and subject, therefore, to onerous
                            terms. In order, then, to avert the catastrophe of a Banking collapse,
                            Congress must pass a <hi rendition="#u">stringent law prohibiting Banks
                                from allowing interest on any sort of deposits</hi>.“ Such
                            legislation would be futile and mischievous. The Comptroller proposes

                            been made away within a clandestine manner, and a leading authority in
                            New York writes: „The machinery of the N<ex>ational</ex> Bks. has

                            The best way for a shrewd manager of a Nl. Bk. to obtain <hi rendition="#u">private</hi> deposits, is to get up an appointment
                            for his institution as a depository of Gvt. fund.“ Sagt ferner: the
                            increasing number of Banks which even on the face of their quarterly
                            returns do <hi rendition="#u">not</hi> hold the amount of cash reserved
                            required by law. The returns of <hi rendition="#u">October 1866</hi>
                            showed that 55 Banks then held reserves considerably below the
                            prescribed limit. It is now complained in New York, „that the
                            Comptroller has not announced publicly how <hi rendition="#u">many of
                                the Banks are defaulters in their reserves since Oct. 1866</hi>, nor
                            what measures have been taken to correct this serious defect“.</p>
            <p>Up to March, 1865, or just at the close of the War, the circulation of the Nl. Banks
                            no more than about 25 Mill. <hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> St. The expansion
                            to the present limit of 50 millions <hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> is the
                            work of the 2 last years. Their paid up capital only 30 mill. <hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> in March 1865, has risen to 84 mill. <hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> since that time. The advantage and strength
                            of <hi rendition="#u">the State Banks</hi> arose from 1) Rigid
                            enforcement of cash payments; u<ex>nd</ex> 2) perfect freetrade, subject
                            to a few reasonable preliminaries in banking business. The danger and
                            weakness of the <hi rendition="#u">National Banks</hi> arises: 1) They
                            have been called into existence, and been distributed over the country
                            by arbitrary discretion of a public officer, acting in most cases in
                            perfect ignorance or misapprehension of circumstances, exceedingly prone
                            to be influenced by motives of party patronage, and chiefly intent not
                            on supplying the fittest banking institutions to the several parts of
                            the Union, but on finding active and wealthy sympathisers with the
                            Republican party, who, through the medium of the Nl. Banks, would
                            support, first, Northern measures, and next, the views of the majority
                            of Congress. 2) Under conditions like these, Nl. Banks have been set up
                            by persons, having no adequate knowledge of the business. They have
                            started a Bank either chiefly as a party measure, or as a convenient
                            mode of getting nearly double rates of interest for their money, or with
                            a view of attracting deposits and employing them in private speculation
                            of their own, or with the object of commanding a deposit of public
                            money, and becoming Gvt. financial agents. 3) As the Circulation of the
                                Nat<ex>ional</ex> Banks is essentially general and not local, the
                            check of <hi rendition="#u">constant liability to its return through the
                                exchanges does not operate</hi>. 4) The supervision of the
                            Comptroller at Washington over 1600 Banks, of necessity, almost
                            worthless for any purposes of practical control, ausserdem nicht
                            desirable that all the Banking instit<ex>utions</ex> of a country

            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">imperfections of the Nl. Bk. System</hi> became already
                            practically manifest: 1) in the <hi rendition="#u">admitted imperfection
                                of the returns made by the Banks</hi>; 2) admitted abuses prevailing
                            in the administration of many of them; 3) admitted exercise of
                            unjustifiable patronage in the selection of particular banks to be
                            depositories of public money, and to be financial agents; 4) admitted
                            necessity of further stringent legislation (f. i., the prohibition of
                            interest on deposits)</p>
            <p>If no modifications speedily introduced: The large number of incompetent,
                            inexperienced, careless, scheming and speculating people, who have
                            forced themselves or been attracted into the control of the Nl. Banks,
                            will grossly mismanage the business; dissipate the deposits in foolish
                            or disreputable advances, and the Banks will fail. Under the law of
                            prior lien, the Gvt. will, out of any available assets, as far as
                            possible, pay itself first, and in full, and the ordinary creditors, as
                            in the recent case of New Orleans, will be left without a farthing. The

            <p>System of Trades Unions would in all probability <hi rendition="#u">raise wages</hi>.
                                <hi rendition="#u">Supply</hi> is not the mere quantity of an
                            article in the market for the moment. We must take into account the
                            desires and needs of the <hi rendition="#u">suppliers</hi>. Great
                            Western stock was, and, indeed, still is, above what figures show to be
                            its fair value, because it was <hi rendition="#u">„well held“</hi>; that
                            is, its proprietors had <hi rendition="#u">no need to sell at once</hi>,
                            and could afford to take <hi rendition="#u">the chance of future
                                improvement</hi>. Rice z. B. falls of m<ex>it</ex>

                            <hi rendition="#u">demand</hi>. In fact, some great holders of rice have
                                <hi rendition="#u">large bills to meet</hi>, and so to clear his
                            liabilities, he was forced to sell at a sacrifice. This mental element
                            in „supply“ the most obvious fact about the moneymarket for months. Many
                            good stocks u<ex>nd</ex> shares have been at an absurd discount, because
                            the proprietors were very anxious to sell, either to <hi rendition="#u">pay off liabilities incurred</hi>, or because, having suffered much
                            by bad shares, they wished to be „out of those things“ at any cost.</p>
            <p>By accumulated funds and an organised concert, trades unions enable the working
                            classes to remain unemployed if they choose; während d<ex>er</ex>

                            cannot remain out of work or out of the poorhouse for a week. Abzuziehn

                                the occasional loss by strikes</hi>. But the expense of strikes is
                            occasional, while the benefit of being a better seller is constant, and
                            a very heavy cost in machinery and management will not seem too much to
                            those who have watched in other markets how powerless weak sellers are,
                            and how sure the price of the commodity is to go down when a large
                            dealer has liabilities which he cannot meet unless he sells. The <hi rendition="#u">lock out by the masters</hi> is the <hi rendition="#u">plain and obvious reply to the strike by the
                            men</hi>. The whole is a rough sort of bargaining, and the party which
                            can hold out longest wins.</p>
            <p>Labour has a law by which it is propagated; capital a law by which it is accumulated.
                            Capitalists can by no combination force wages lower than the rate at
                            which labourers choose to marry and have children. Labourers can by no
                            combination force profits beyond a rate at which monied people think it
                            worth while to go into business. But <hi rendition="#u">between these
                                limits</hi> and at every particular instant, wages and profits are
                            determined by a sort of wholesale „higgling of the market.“ As to wages,
                            the chance is that a sudden and simultaneous introduction of a
                            combination system among labourers in all trades would have a tendency
                            to raise wages. As a rule, a new force favourable to one party to a
                            bargain will help him to make a better bargain. Would such a <hi rendition="#u">general rise of wages</hi> raise, or tend to raise
                                <hi rendition="#u">prices (of commodities</hi>)? Obviously not. A
                            cause which operates generally upon, and equally upon, the cost of
                            production of all articles, cannot affect the exchangeable value of
                            money. A considerable disturbance might and would be caused. Articles
                            into which the cost of hand labour entered largely would rise, and those
                            into which the cost of such labour entered little, but the profit of
                            fixed capital entered much, would fall in comparison. Aber dieß would
                            altogether differ from a general augmentation of all prices. The average
                            remains as it was.</p>

                            causes a diminution of the demand, and can only be obtained by a
                            diminution of the supply; and if the supply is to fall off, labour as
                            well as capital, must leave the trade, and labour will not leave any
                            trade till it is driven hence by bad wages. Also: Wages rise, and force

                            unaltered. Aber Union etc may occur at a time when the trade is

                                tendency. Water tends to find its level, but still much water is
                                always higher than other water, and on that account is in motion to
                                descend to the usual level. Just so the profit in particular trades
                                may, even for considerable periods, be higher than in other
                                trades,</hi> though a perpetually acting cause tends to bring about
                            an average and common equality. If a Trade Union should be introduced
                            into a trade at a period of unusually elevated profits, it might raise
                            wages without raising profits. Profits being higher than usual, capital
                            would <seg type="comment"><orig>(auch ohne Unions)</orig><note xml:id="ngnj_t1d_d3b">Zusatz von Marx.</note></seg> come in <hi rendition="#u">and compete for that sort of labour</hi>

                            from sheer starvation. County isolated. Its resources in grain
                            sufficient for ordinary years, but its isolation, preventing exports,
                            prevented also the accumulation of stores. It was useless to grow more
                            than a neighbourhood could eat in a year, for if an extra quantity was
                            grown the money value of the new harvest proportionately declined. <hi rendition="#mMM">This money value of extreme value to the farmer, as
                                he <hi rendition="#u">had to pay his rent in cash</hi>, which he
                                gets only by the sale of his grain within a very limited area. Each
                                farmer, therefore, grew what he and his dependents needed, plus a
                                very small</hi> value to non agricultural persons, and plus a store
                            adequate to his own support for a few months. At the same time, the
                            labouring class of Orissa – the <hi rendition="#u">class without any
                                land</hi> – was for India unusually large, probably <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> or <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi> of the whole
                            population. They were prosperous, the Ooreyahs, as they are called,
                            occupying in Bengal just the position of Auvergnats in France,
                            emigrating readily, and finding in the cities preferential employ as
                            servants of almost all descriptions. Thrifty up to the Auvergnat point,
                            3 × more than Scotch cottiers, but, living on monthly wages, they of
                            course store up nothing <hi rendition="#u">except cash</hi>. Harvest of

                                money but nothing to eat.</hi> To the last, the <hi rendition="#u">peasant proprietors</hi> managed to exist, each man hoarding some

                            never store their grain to any great extent, for if they do they can
                            never hope to sell it. Each township grows enough for itself, and a man
                            with a 1000 bags of rice which he cannot move is just as poor as the man
                            with only one – indeed poorer, for he has spent <pb n="152"/> labour on
                            unprofitable works. This has repeatedly occurred in <hi rendition="#u">parts of India, notably in the Punjab</hi>, where the people, after
                            an enormous harvest, have been unable to pay their rent. Nobody in the
                            neighbourhood wanted their grain, and carriage to a distance was
                            impossible, till it was in one instance at least <hi rendition="#u">officially reported that the wheat in the Punjab would feed the

                            Vicar of Halberton, in <hi rendition="#u">Devon</hi>) in a letter to a
                            newspaper, stated that there are about 60 farms in his parish, and that,
                            with very few exceptions, the pay of the ablebodied agricultural
                            labourers is there 8s. a week; in some cases only 7. And that a like
                            scale of wages prevails throughout a large part of Devonshire. He added:
                            „In many instances, deduction is made, not only for rent, but for grist
                            at the farmers’ price, so that the labourer sometimes does not carry
                            home more than 3s. 6d. in coin. I know 2 strong lads in one family, aged
                            resp. 16 and 14, who receive from the farmer who employs them, the one
                            3s. 9d., the other 2s. 6d. a week; and the farmer, reckoning these
                            miserable earnings of the 2 lads together with the father’s wages,
                            stated in a public paper <hi rendition="#u">that he gave his labourer
                                14s. a week</hi>.“ Another Vicar in <hi rendition="#u">Hampshire</hi> says: „The wages received by an able-bodied labourer
                            when engaged in <pb n="156"/> ordinary work is 9s. a week. Out of this
                            they have to pay one s. a week for houserent. … There is no ale, cider,
                            or any other emolument given.“ Well, does any one wonder that rural
                            labourers get away from Devonshire and Hampshire the first available
                            opportunity? … How are the farm wages of such districts to be increased?
                            To some extent <hi rendition="#u">by the depletion of the market</hi>.
                            But this process, especially in backwards regions of the West of
                            England, must be a slow one. … If most of the estates in England were
                            judiciously managed, some of the present tenants must, perhaps, either
                            give up their farms, or give up some portion of their land.</p>

                            is „practically no market“, i. e. the property cannot be sold at all or
                            for anything; and, therefore, the directors are obliged to value it
                            themselves. Of course, we do not know what the Co. gave for these
                            shares; some of them may have been bought in cheap market, others
                            allotted under par by special arrangement. Dann noch the value of the

                            no inconvertible paper. Yet India can borrow at 5%. <hi rendition="#u">Michell</hi> says, as to the unknown quantity of inconvertible
                            notes: „The accounts between the Treasury and the State Bank are so
                            complicated as to defy any inquiry for the purpose of making a statement
                            beyond dispute. <hi rendition="#u">Practically, the state helps itself
                                to whatever it wants from the Bank</hi>, which is thereby compelled
                            to issue more inconvertible notes to „strengthen the branches“, and thus
                            to suspend its own charter. The Treasury has broken the State Bank, for
                            it has long been unable meet <hi rendition="#u">its engagements to pay
                                specie</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Nor could it return to the public
                                their deposits if demanded</hi>, except by a corresponding new issue
                            of inconvertible paper. „Irrespective of 45,000 men serving in the
                            Imperial army, the 800,000 rank and file, supplied by a total population
                            of about 55 millions, constitutes 1<hi rendition="#sup">4</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">10</hi>% of that portion of the population liable
                            to conscription, while the numerical relation of the army to the
                            population of the empire (70 mill.) exceeds that of exceeds that of
                            France and Prussia by <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">3</hi>.“</p>
            <p>„At the same time“, says Michell „the number of young men eligible in Russia for
                            service is comparatively far smaller than in other countries of Europe,
                            where about 1% of the population yearly reaches the age of 20 years, and
                            of these 40<supplied cert="high">%</supplied> are fitted for military
                            service. In Russia, owing to the mortality of the children, it takes
                            50 millions of the population to produce the number of young men of 20
                            years that France can command with a population of 38 mill. According to
                            this calculation, the number of men of the class liable to military
                            service, who reach the age of 20 years in Russia, about 400,000 p. an.;

                                Massachusetts</hi>. By its laws every township is bound to keep up
                            common schools for the instruction of all the children of the township
                            in the rudiments of education. Every <hi rendition="#u">township
                                containing 500 families</hi> or householders, is, in addition, to
                            keep up a <hi rendition="#u">high school of the second class</hi>, in
                            which general history, bookkeeping, surveying, geometry, natural
                            philosophy, chemistry, botany, the civil polity of the State itself and
                            of the U. States, and Latin are to be taught. And every <hi rendition="#u">township containing 4000 inhabitants</hi> is further
                            to provide instruction in Greek, French, astronomy, geology, rhetoric,
                            logic, intellectual and moral science, and political economy. <hi rendition="#u">These schools are supported almost entirely by local
                                taxation.</hi> There is a <hi rendition="#u">State School Fund</hi>,
                            contributing towards their expenses, but this contribution is small,
                            positively and relatively. <hi rendition="#u">In 1864</hi>, the average
                            sum contributed by the <hi rendition="#u">State School Fund</hi> less
                            than <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi>$ for each

                            States they are permitted, but limited by law. Where they do not exist,
                            each township is bound to raise such sums of money for the support of
                            its schools as it judges necessary. If it refuses or neglects to raise
                            the money, or to choose a school committee, it is liable to penalties,
                            and receives no aid from the State School fund unless it raises 1<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>$ for each person
                            between 5 and 15. These penalties difficult of infliction, and instances
                            where they are evaded. The law says the common schools are to be kept
                            for at least 6 months in the year. In 1864 more than <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> of townships
                            failed in this respect. 32 townships out of 68 (of more than 4000
                            inhabitants) did keep no First class school <hi rendition="#u">(as by

            <p>Any person who contracts a debt comes under an obligation to pay money. … A bill or
                            note may have the effect of postponing the payment of the debtor, while,
                            at the same time, enabling the creditor to anticipate the effect of
                            payment. But the creditor can only realise in the present by the
                            possession of a bill or note the effect of a future payment, by finding
                            some one who has loanable capital at command. When trade is in a natural
                            condition, the supply of this floating uninvested capital is usually
                            equal to the demand, and the interest for loans at its normal state.
                            Aber when a period of speculation and excitement, with inflated prices,
                            had led to a general extension of transactions, there is necessarily, an
                            increase in the amount of indebtedness. When this indebtedness has to be
                            liquidated, it is found that there has been no corresponding increase in
                            the supply of unemployed capital. In fact, the supply in such cases is
                            generally smaller; for many who formerly preferred the small but sure
                            return from interests to the risk of speculation may have been induced
                            by the contagion of such excitement, and the example of large gains, to
                            withdraw their capital from its accustomed employment, and to embark it
                            in the ventures of the day. The demands for loan having increased, and
                            the supply to meet it diminished, advance nothwendig in the rates of
                            interest demanded by holders and offered by borrowers? Such an advance
                            in the rate of interest is simply an indication that enterprise and
                            speculation have exceeded the limits beyond which they cannot pass with
                            safety. … At last the amount of debt so far exceeds the amount of
                            available loanable capital that a money crisis or panic ensues.</p>

                            symptoms of the financial pressure that continued with but slight
                            intermissions until its culmination on the 11. May, 1866.</p>
            <p>The high rates given for deposits have proved so attractive, that the amount
                            deposited at call, or short notice, in the London Joint Stock Banks
                            alone, now amounts to about 100 millions. F<ex>ür</ex> diese immense
                            liability they keep a small reserve of money in the B. o. England. Diese
                            Bank proceeds to do with them what the bankers who lodged them felt
                            could not be done with safety – it uses them for the discount of
                            mercantile paper, or it includes them with its own reserve. Now, the
                            same money cannot be a reserve for the joint stock Banks and a reserve
                            for the B. o. E. also. It is, in fact, no reserve for the Bk. of England
                            at all, and it ought not to appear as such in their weekly statements,
                            but be noted as <hi rendition="#u">„cash held on account of
                                bankers“</hi>. In May, 1866, the total reserve shown in those
                            statements seemed at first sight not be unsatisfactory, but it was in
                            reality less than the balance held on account of other bankers, so that
                            at <hi rendition="#u">that time the B. o. E. had no reserve of its own
                                whatever</hi>.</p>
            <p>We see in the recent history and present position of the commerce of the U. St. a
                            striking example of the effects of an inconvertible currency. Deprived
                            of the healthy check of convertibility, it was certain to become
                            redundant. There had been in that country all the symptoms of a
                            fictitious prosperity – the feeling of an universal increase of wealth.
                            This apparent increase in the value of <pb n="168"/> all property from
                            the inflation of prices was so deceptive, that it misled a leading

                            only enriched the nation, but added to the wealth of every individual in
                            it. … An artificial level of prices stimulated importations, but it
                            destroyed their export trade, and a heavy balance, due to foreign
                            countries, accumulated against them. To pay this, the money by which

            <p>The Prussian Rent Banks seem to us a rudimentary and infantine financial device …
                                <persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000004577">Stein</persName> had to buy
                            out, on behalf of the peasant cultivators, the manorial Lord. The
                            Rentbanks – no banks at all – were simply a Gvt. department charged with
                            this peculiar financial arrangement. The Govt. valued the interest of
                            the „lord“ at such and at such a sum, and issued to him bonds with 4%
                            interest – bonds in every sort of sum from 30s. to 150<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> – payable at the option of the Gvt., but <hi rendition="#u">not</hi> at the holder’s option. The landlord was compelled to take
                            them, and the idea of issuing them in various sums was that he might
                            keep them or pay them away – in every mode that he thought fit. These
                            bonds were secured on the estate, and the tenant was obliged to pay a
                            certain rent-charge annually for their liquidation. There was an annual
                            „drawing“ (Ziehn wir bei Losen), according to the continental fashion,
                            and the bonds „then drawn“ were discharged out of the sums so paid by
                            the peasants. If the peasants did not pay their annual <hi rendition="#u">quota</hi>, the State took and used very ample powers
                            of entry and confiscation. D<ex>er</ex> Lord forced to <hi rendition="#u">take</hi> these bonds. It is plainly a severe act of
                            despotic finance. … In fact, <hi rendition="#u">no interest-bearing
                                security</hi> is really suitable to <hi rendition="#u">currency
                                purposes</hi>, because its value changes from day to day. The
                            interest accrues <hi rendition="#u">de die in diem</hi>. It is one thing
                            on the 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> Oct., and a greater on the 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> Oct.; a <hi rendition="#u">sum</hi>,
                            therefore, has to be done whenever the bond changes hands, and no
                            population has ever borne, or will ever bear, a kind of currency
                            requiring so much labour. <pb n="169"/> Prussia may have much to teach
                            us in other departments; <hi rendition="#u">but, surely money is our own

                            to lie idle in a vault as long as the amount of banknotes which
                            represents it is in circulation, is a very different thing from being a
                            dealer in bullion, nor does it involve any transactions in either home
                            or foreign securities. The <hi rendition="#u">H. o. C. must
                                determine</hi> what <hi rendition="#u">amount of banknotes may be
                                issued against securities other than gold coin or bullion</hi>

                            should be unalterable without their consent. The duty of the Gvt. would
                            be simply to take care that any one who wanted banknotes for bullion or
                            gold coin should be able to get them, or <hi rendition="#u">vice
                                versa</hi>. This could be arranged by 3 issuing establishments at
                            London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, where stores of bullion, gold coin, and
                            banknotes should be kept for the purpose of being exchanged one for the
                            other according to the wants of the public. The State banknotes <hi rendition="#u">legal tender</hi> everywhere but at the issuing
                            establishments; here they would be simple certificates on gold. They
                            should go as low as one sovereign; dadurch holders of banknotes kept
                            away from the issuing establishments until they required gold for

            <p>Low price of Bank Shares now and high prices derselben 2 years ago. As a rule people
                            do not keep at the bankers, without interest, more than the sum of money
                            which they want <hi rendition="#u">for current expenditure</hi>, and
                            this they must keep somewhere. If a man distrusts the old banker, he
                            selects a new banker, and the aggregate result – the sum total of money
                            – on the running accounts of all banks is not diminished. Auch

                            people do not know what better to do with their money. They do not like

                            disputes with masters, and aids in emigration, as well as upon the loss
                            of trade tools. Mr. Tucker, the Actuary, stated he could form no
                            estimate of the liabilities from such sources; as they depend upon human
                            passions. When a Trades’ Union will quarrel with an employer, or pay
                            members to leave the district, cannot be determined by statistics. If a
                            merchant were asked to pay his life insurance premiums, <hi rendition="#u">either</hi> to defray the costs of <hi rendition="#u">„lock-outs“</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">or</hi> to provide for his
                            family after his death, he would think the proposer mad … It may be said
                            a member <pb n="173"/> of a Trades’ Union might make himself tolerably
                            safe by paying a considerable weekly payment <hi rendition="#u">in
                                addition</hi> to that required by benefit societies by paying <hi rendition="#u">a large strike premium</hi> over and above his common
                            benefit premium. But he does precisely the reverse. The actuary who
                            reported upon the 2 model societies (Engin<ex>eers</ex> u<ex>nd</ex>
                                Carp<ex>enters</ex>) reported that, <hi rendition="#u">even as
                                benefit societies</hi>, and not including the wages-augmenting
                            element, <hi rendition="#u">they were completely insolvent</hi>. The
                            subscriptions utterly inadequate even for an ordinary benefit society.
                            „If“, says Tucker, the actuary, „the society continues to be conducted
                            upon its present footed, although a continued influx of new members may
                            defer the period, the Am<ex>algamated</ex> Carpenters u<ex>nd</ex>
                            Joiners Soc<ex>iety</ex> must ultimately become bankrupt.“ A society
                            which has such future liabilities as a superannuation, may easily have
                            large funds in hand, and yet be wholly unsound; more especially when it
                            has been very many years in existence, and only admits young members. In
                            the first years of a superannuation office, as in the first years of a
                            life insurance, <hi rendition="#u">the incomings are present, but the
                                outgoings are postponed</hi>. Members are attracted by the „strike
                            element“ to join bad benefit societies. The Central Committee of the
                            Union are sure to have immense funds in hand from the „benefit
                            payments“. Out of the monies subscribed for sickness and old age they
                            can, if they like, fight the employers. If they had to deal with a
                            strike fund alone, they would have in comparison but an empty treasury.
                            The constant hopes and the continual payments of a benefit society keep
                            the strike society together; but if the strike society cannot hold
                            together of itself, it ought to fall. One of the first and most
                            necessary reforms is the separation of the 2 elements of the provident
                            fund from the „contentious fund“.</p>

            <p>The societies are as yet financially young; their superannuation fund does not begin
                            to tell for years, because they only take young members. Therefore,

                            law relating to <hi rendition="#u">Friendly
                                Societies<?oxy_comment_end?></hi>, followed by a whole crowd of
                            successors. Ihr aim: to exempt from the general prohibition of
                            combination certain particular associations so as to encourage and
                            protect „by voluntary subscriptions of the member thereof, separate
                            funds for the mutual relief and maintenance of the members in sickness,
                            age, infirmity“. Viele <hi rendition="#u">„friendly Societies“</hi>
                            solvent, many insolvent. Und insolvency often very gross, selbst in sehr
                            respectable societies. Thus „The Preston Branch of the Manchester Union“
                            had a deficiency of 23,880. The <hi rendition="#u">favours given to the
                                Friendly Societies</hi>:</p>
            <p>1) The right of suing, and being sued at law, especially, what was vital, the right
                            of suing their own members for arrears, and their own officers for
                            defalcation. The right was, indeed, given in an absurd way. In the case
                            of <hi rendition="#u">Joint Stock banks</hi>, those constituted under
                            the original Act, cannot <hi rendition="#u">sue for themselves</hi>, a
                                <hi rendition="#u">public officer must sue for them</hi>. Friendly
                            Societies are under the same disability; they cannot sue on their own
                            account as a Railway Co. does; <hi rendition="#u">a trustee</hi> has to
                            sue for them.</p>
            <p>2) <hi rendition="#u">Exemption of the transfer of interests in them from certain
                                stamp duties,</hi> though only to a certain amount.</p>
            <p>Wegen dieser privileges d<ex>er</ex> Friendly Societies, <hi rendition="#u">all other
                                associations of workmen</hi> tried to be <hi rendition="#u">Friendly
                                Societies</hi> whatever else they were, and so to gain the right of
                            suing their defaulting members and officers. Und dieß um so easier als,
                            by a series of enactments, it had become very difficult to say what a
                            Friendly Society was or was not. No blame can be attached to the
                            founders of the Trades Unions for coupling together 2 antagonistic aims,
                            for the law encouraged them in it, and gave them no chance of gaining
                            that for which they most cared, unless they attempted the other also.
                            The attempt was, however, vain. Aber Judges decided that <hi rendition="#u">Strike Societies</hi> were <hi rendition="#u">illegal
                                as in restraint of trade</hi>; and, therefore, that although they
                            were benefit societies also, they could not sue for payments in arrears
                            by members, or for sums in the custody of defaulting and resisting
                            officers. So d<ex>ie</ex> Trades Unions are now wholly unable either to
                            sue or be sued. No legal defect can be more absurd or fatal. We cannot
                            understand those who wish that these societies should be half legal and
                            half illegal. That they be permitted to combine, but not allowed to
                            provide the funds which alone make that combination effectual. Abolish
                            all notion of wages-combinations being in restraint of trade; we
                            professed to legalise these combinations years ago, and now it would be
                            impossible to destroy them by a sidewind, and pernicious to attempt
                            it.</p>

            <p>Early, in <hi rendition="#u">1866</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">the London, Chatham and

                            security of these alleged available lands, Peto arranged on 21 Febr.
                            1866, for an advance of 135,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> from the then

                            which failed in June, 1866, and for 190,000<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>.
                            (in all 325,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>) from the <hi rendition="#u">General Credit and Finance Company</hi>. These 2 Cos. were not to
                            advance any actual money at all. They were to give their acceptance to

                            be handed to the <hi rendition="#u">Borrowers „for Discount“</hi>. The
                            Credit cos. were to be paid a commission of 5% for the twelvemonth;
                            i. e. 6,750<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> as commission on the 135,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> u<ex>nd</ex> 9,500<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>.
                            as commission on the 190,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>; and in the

                            advance, the rate of interest to be charged by them was to be 4%

                            never to be computed for this purpose at less than 8% p. a.; so that for
                            the use of actual cash, the Borrowers had to pay 12% interest and 5%
                            commission.</p>
            <p>The following are the <hi rendition="#u">actual clauses</hi> of the <hi rendition="#u">Deed</hi> of 21 Feb. 1866:</p>
            <p>3) „The <hi rendition="#u">Credit Co.</hi>
                            <hi rendition="#u">(Mercantile Credit Assoc<ex>iation)</ex></hi> will
                            advance to the said Sir M. Peto the sum of 135,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi>, and such advance shall be made <hi rendition="#u">by Bills
                                of Exchange to be from time to time drawn by firms or individuals
                                resident on the Continent of Europe</hi> and on that behalf approved
                            by the Credit Co, who shall accept the same accordingly, and deliver the
                            same to the said trustees <hi rendition="#u">for discount</hi>.“</p>
            <p>4) „The said advance and credit shall continue for the space of 12 Calendar Months
                            from the 21 Febr. 1866, and during that period all Bills <hi rendition="#u">to be accepted by the Credit Co. as aforesaid</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">shall
                                be satisfied out of the proceeds from fresh Bills to be drawn
                                on</hi> and accepted by the Credit Company as aforesaid, so that the
                            Credit Co. shall never be called on to pay the said Bills or any of
                            them.“</p>
            <p>6) „The said Sir M. Peto shall pay all stamps in respect of the said Bills, and all
                            costs and charges and expenses of, or in anywise incident to, the said
                            loan or transaction.“</p>
            <p>7) „The said Sir M. Peto shall, as and when the Bills for the said sum of 135,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> be presented for acceptance, <hi rendition="#u">as the consideration for such acceptance</hi>, pay to
                            the Credit Co a <hi rendition="#u">commission of 5<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> p. c. on the amount</hi> thereof for the whole period
                            of 12 months.<supplied cert="high">“</supplied></p>
            <p>8) In case the Credit Co. shall pay any of the Bills so drawn as foresaid, the said
                            Sir M. Peto will forthwith repay to them the amount paid by them, <hi rendition="#u">with interest thereon at the rate of 4<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> p. c. above the current rate of discount
                                at the time being</hi>, at the Bank of England, from the time of
                            such payment to the time of such repayment as aforesaid, such Bankrates
                            never to be computed <hi rendition="#u">at less than 8%</hi>.</p>
            <p>The 325,000<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>. in money was to be taken from the Discount
                            Market, at any rates which might be necessary, and applied to the
                            purchase of materials for partly finishing <pb n="178"/> a London
                            Railway. But the <hi rendition="#u">transaction was to be disguised</hi>
                            by procuring Bills to be drawn from abroad in amounts, appearance, and
                            dates, as nearly like ordinary mercantile Bills as possible, and the
                            process was to go on by means of renewals for at least a year. The
                            Finance Co. came forward as the intermediate party, and carried off 5%
                            commission for the use of his name.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#mMM">We see, in this case, the exact details of the kind of
                                transactions by means of which the Rate of Discount was carried to
                                and maintained at the exorbitant figures which prevailed so long
                                before the final collapse of May 1866. So long as <hi rendition="#u">Overend and Co.</hi>

                                keep their credit, there was a place in London where Bills of the
                                kind in question were not too severely criticised.</hi></p>
            <p>The Finance Co. fared badly by this transaction. Of course the „firms or individuals
                            resident on the Continent <hi rendition="#u">of Europe</hi>“ being
                            mostly boys in offices signing Bills at a few shillings a quire were
                            quite unprepared to provide 325,000<hi rendition="#i">l</hi>. Peto was
                            still less prepared – and the <orgName key="ed_dkw_djk_w2b">London,
                                Chatham, and Dover Railway</orgName> even still less than Peto. The
                            Finance Cos., therefore, were left to find the money as well as they
                            could, <choice>

                            employer of labour in the Midland counties.</p>
            <p>Of any particular trade, it is usual to say that the price of labour ought to be the
                same as in any other trade, but this, <hi rendition="#mMM">if true, only shifts the
                    difficulty for what then settles the price of labour in all trades. And, in
                    accurate science, it is not true, for <hi rendition="#u">a rise or fall in
                        wages</hi>, when legitimate, must</hi> begin somewhere, and the trade which
                takes the lead ought not to be proscribed because it is the first.</p>
            <pb n="181"/>
            <p>Some say: „Trades’ Unions are not wanted; the men need not be disappointed at not
                            getting an increase of wages now. Capital will flow into the trade, if
                            wages there are lower than in other trades, and the incoming of that
                            capital will at once raise wages.“ Aber, thus it may be said, when
                            masters propose a reduction: „You, too, need not be so anxious about it;
                            if you do not get the reduction now, you will get it soon,“ – that is if
                            you ought to get it. Supposing wages are higher in that trade than in
                            other trades, capital will flow out of the trade, and that which remains
                            will be rewarded better. Of course both these augments are arguments of
                            pure theory; no capitalist ever voluntarily submitted to pay more wages
                            than he could help, because, even if he did so, wages would be gradually
                            reduced by an inevitable diminution of competition; nor will labourers
                            ever, to the end of the world, give up a claim to an augmentation of
                            wages, because <hi rendition="#u">their successors</hi>, or even
                            themselves in later life, will have an increase by the gradual
                            augmentation of employment. Both capitalist and operative always look to
                            the present, and not to the future market.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Mundella</hi> sucht zu settle by friendly bargain. Since 1860, he
                            and others have worked at Nottingham a joint council of operatives and
                            capitalists, who after due argument settle what shall be paid. These he
                            calls courts of conciliation. <hi rendition="#u">As to their structure
                                we own we are rather sceptical.</hi> We fear the <hi rendition="#u">critical question will be:</hi>
                            <hi rendition="#u">„Is the casting vote to be given to the master or to
                                or to the workmen?“</hi> As to the decision of any tribunal, we have
                            great doubts. Aber jedenfalls „Before a strike has occurred, it is far
                            easier to reason calmly than after a strike.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Mundella says:</hi> „When difficulties m<ex>it</ex> d<ex>en</ex>
                            workmen – they had the actual samples of the native and foreign
                            manufacture on the table before them, with the prices: they went into
                            the whole question of competition, and showed the delegate (of the
                            workmen) that with the increase demanded, it was impossible to compete
                            with the foreign trade. Experience of 7 years“ zufrieden stellend.</p>
            <p>We doubt, <hi rendition="#u">says Econ<ex>omist</ex></hi>, about the composition of
                the Nottingham board, but as to the desirability of some such board, and some such
                discussion, at all places, we have no doubt whatever.</p>

                        <p>Kein solcher Panic seit 1825. For a long time previously, day after day,
                            and week after week, <hi rendition="#u">persistent endeavours</hi> in
                            the <hi rendition="#u">Times</hi>, to bring all the financial
                            associations into disrepute. Continual repetition of damaging
                            insinuations could not fail to prove injurious to the credit of these
                            Cos. and depreciate to some extent the <hi rendition="#u">value of their
                                shares, as well as the value of the securities on which their
                                advances had been made</hi>. When the favourable moment arrived,
                            therefore, when the disreputable doings of the Joint Stock Discount Co.
                            and the Contract Corporation had excited a large amount of public
                            suspicion and distrust, and the imminence of a great Continental War was
                            added, the speculations for a fall in the Stock Exchange had every
                            inducement to extend immensely their operations, and every reason to
                            calculate upon their success. <hi rendition="#u">These operations</hi>,
                            it is said, <hi rendition="#u">have resulted in the realisation of large
                                fortunes by many of the adverse speculators</hi>. For the Cos which
                            were at all „financially weak“ – the effect was crushing. The <hi rendition="#u">depreciation in the market price of their shares</hi>
                            was certain to be accompanied by a <hi rendition="#u">corresponding
                                depreciation in the market value of the securities on which their
                                investments had been made</hi>, and the depreciation of both led
                            their customers to a <hi rendition="#u">withdrawal of deposits</hi>.
                            This the result calculated upon by the speculators, and enforced. <hi rendition="#mMM">But as the conduct of these unscrupulous gamblers,
                                that of <hi rendition="#u">some directors of these Cos</hi> has been
                                infinitely more reprehensible. It is freely said that some of these
                                directors, like certain animals which are known to follow in the
                                trail of other beasts of prey, more savage and courageous than
                                themselves, for the chance of partaking of the offal that may be
                                left behind, have been <hi rendition="#u">following the lead of the
                                    Bears</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">selling on Speculation the

                                to sell, and a fall of prices must therefore ensure, they have
                                followed the movement and have sold also, thereby accelerating and
                                increasing the fall. Suchten dieß to justify or palliate on the

                            directions, in an instant telegraphed to all parts of the country. Dense
                            masses congregated in the streets around the doors. It was clearly
                            perceived that this <hi rendition="#u">Overend stoppage</hi> would be
                            the signal for the commencement on the following morning of a <hi rendition="#u">„run“ upon every other banking and financial
                                establishment</hi>, whose credit had been called into question. „Not
                            even in the panics of 1847 and 1857“, said the <hi rendition="#u">Daily
                                News</hi>, „was the apprehension shown this day equalled. <hi rendition="#u">The circulation of mercantile bills</hi>, however
                            good, is <hi rendition="#u">completely</hi> paralysed. Merchants who
                            have the most <pb n="188"/> undoubted paper find themselves under the
                                <hi rendition="#u">risk of inability to meet their engagements</hi>
                            by reason of the partial or complete <hi rendition="#u">collapse of the
                                money market</hi>“. Even the <hi rendition="#u">Times City
                                Editor</hi> declared that „unless prompt steps were taken, the close
                            of that week would be marked by disasters such as had never been
                            equalled in our commercial history.“ Means must be devised, he urged,
                            for stemming the insane torrent of the panic, or it „would not only
                            affect the metropolis and all the great provincial centres of our
                            commerce, as well as our Indian colonial and the foreign markets, but
                            would at once lead to a suspension of public works throughout the
                            kingdom, and in every district throw thousands of people out of
                            employment.“</p>
                        <p>The time for action had arrived. The only action possible was, in the
                            first instance, <hi rendition="#u">a deputation to <persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000001797">Gladstone</persName></hi>

                                again</hi>, but in fact and in effect <hi rendition="#u">to
                                supersede it</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Friday Morning</hi> (<hi rendition="#u">11 May</hi>) came the anticipated run upon the other

                            the „run“ was well met. Lombard Street was thronged in a most
                            extraordinary manner by crowds and gazers, watching the movements at
                            several banks. So great these crowds that the streets almost impassable

                        <p>So far, indeed, it seems passed for the especial benefit of clever

                            preserve the Co. as well as the client. Shareholders are led away by

                            details to the public or their rivals; recent disclosures have proved
                            that secrecy allows unprincipled directors and managers to carry on
                            abominably reckless transactions, of which the shareholders are in

                        <p>We have been taught to think that the withdrawal of a million or two of

                            … The precious metals always have and always will flow backwards and

                            have produced their ordinary results in encouraging speculation,

                            chiefly to be accounted for by the depreciation of the Currency. The

                        <p>He brings the pretentions of the Act down to one single principle <hi rendition="#u">„that of securing the convertibility of the
                                banknote“</hi>. Aber dieß is no principle at all. D<ex>ie</ex>
                            absolute practical convertibility nur to be secured by <hi rendition="#u">limiting the issues of notes to the amount of gold
                                available for the</hi> purpose; whereas the Act of 1844 authorises
                            the issue of <hi rendition="#u">14 mill. £ Notes</hi>
                            <seg type="comment"><orig>(jezt 15)</orig><note xml:id="nogp_5kv_23b">Zusatz von Marx.</note></seg>
                            <hi rendition="#u">beyond</hi> that amount. Hubbard avows that the
                            promoters of the Act „confidently affirmed that, with the enactment
                            which limited all the credit issues of the country, and secured the
                            convertibility of the notes of the B. o. E., would <hi rendition="#u">result an immunity from speculation, crisis</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">panics</hi>.“ Aber, sagt Hubbard, in fact: „The Act
                            professed to <hi rendition="#u">quiet panics only where panic arose from
                                suspicion to the validity of the B. o. E. note.“</hi> What
                            necessity, then, for passing the Act? Was the note „suspect“ in 1844?
                                <hi rendition="#u">No panic ever did arise from such suspicion.</hi>
                            Hubbard sagt: „Men now transact business <hi rendition="#u">to 10 × and
                                20 ×</hi> the <hi rendition="#u">measure of their means</hi>; in
                            banking the <hi rendition="#u">uninvested deposits are committed</hi> on
                            interest to a money broker, who, gathering the surplus of many bankers,
                            lends them against higher interest, and without reserve, so that, when
                            the depositor calls upon the banker and the banker upon broker, the
                            broker is unable to refund.“</p>
                        <p>It is the <hi rendition="#u">limitation of Bank note issues</hi> which
                            causes and aggravates panics, and <hi rendition="#u">it is not</hi> that
                            limitation which stops a drain of gold, whether internal or external,
                            which is the main object Hubbard has in view. It is the <hi rendition="#u">rate of discount</hi> which effects that object now,
                                u<ex>nd</ex> it can do it without the limitation of issues. The rate
                            of discount, <hi rendition="#u">regulated by reserve of gold</hi>, is
                            sufficient.</p>

                        <p>All traders require a <hi rendition="#u">reserve of ready cash</hi>; this
                            reserve of being kept about the person or in some hiding place, is put
                            into a bank. The banker can afford to pay the possessor something for
                            the use of it, and makes a profit upon <hi rendition="#u">lending it
                                again</hi>. Those to whom the banker lends again make use of the
                            money and again make profit; and so it goes on, and the first deposit
                            with a banker is used over and over again. <hi rendition="#u">This is
                                credit.</hi> Upon this credit basis our trade has increased and
                            wealth accumulated. A cheque upon a banker answers the purpose of
                            banknotes; and the substitution of cheques for banknotes during the past
                            20 years has enabled us to dispense with banknotes. There are <hi rendition="#u">„banking facilities“</hi>. In a word, <hi rendition="#u">increased banking is increased currency</hi>. The
                            restricted currency of the Bank Act of 1844 has been corrected by
                            increased banking faculties. … In the ordinary course bankers can
                            calculate with tolerable accuracy the average deposits of their
                            customers. If the balance of one customer is smaller than usual, that of
                            another is larger, and the medium average is fairly calculable. Bankers,
                            therefore, as a rule, <hi rendition="#u">lend again the loans of their
                                depositors</hi>, retaining as a reserve for emergencies 10 to 12% of
                            the whole, and thus, in an average condition of credit, the <hi rendition="#u">same deposits</hi> of a banker are <hi rendition="#u">used over again performing the functions of currency by
                                cheques</hi> equally with banknotes. … In Zeit of discredit, wie
                            jezt: Our <hi rendition="#u">currency</hi>, as expressed by bankers’
                            balances, is thus, or has been, in process of contraction, and, in
                            proportion as deposits are withdrawn by timid customers, bankers have
                            less and less to lend. Moreover, if some depositors draw out money from
                            banks, other may; and bankers must be more cautious than usual, and must
                            increase their reserves by holding more notes and gold. The <hi rendition="#u">whole credit machine has been put out of gear</hi> …

                            probably 200 mill. or more. What <pb n="196"/> portion of this currency
                            of credit is now practically extinguished by the panic no one can tell …
                            The 20 or 25 Mill. of B. o. E. notes nominally constituting the chief
                            paper currency of the currency, is a mere bagatelle by <hi rendition="#u">comparison m<ex>it</ex> other forms of credit
                                fulfilling the functions of currency</hi> … Destroy this banking
                            system by impaired credit, and the chief part of this form of currency
                            is swept away. This is panic. … <hi rendition="#u">In France</hi> the
                            credit-structure is <hi rendition="#u">diminutive</hi> by comparison
                            with our own, and consequently there is much less open to destruction
                            when discredit comes, and much less room for discredit …</p>
                        <p>By law of 1844, in this country, the basis of all our credit is made <hi rendition="#u">the accidental cash balance at the Bk. of
                                England</hi>. By this law, and the usages of that law, cash balance
                            of 20 mill., or so much gold u<ex>nd</ex> silver at the Bank o. E., is
                            considered more than ample for any superstructure of credit, and British
                            bankers lend 100, 200, or 300 mill. of deposit freely, and the rate of
                            discount low. It is a question of <hi rendition="#u">how borrowers</hi>
                            can be found. On the other hand, metallic cash balance at B. o. E. of
                            only 10 Mill. £, instead of 20, is regarded as ruinous, and the credit
                            fabric vanishes. Brit<ex>ish</ex> bankers lend nothing, call in their
                            outstanding debts, <hi rendition="#u">lose</hi> their deposits, and <hi rendition="#u">make</hi> panic; then the question arises where <hi rendition="#u">lenders</hi> are to be found of any money on any
                            security. The bankers <hi rendition="#u">cannot</hi> lend. Both
                            ridiculous extremes, they belong alone to the law of 1844.</p>
                        <p>French commerce has not been educated by law to build much upon a purely
                            accidental stock of bullion, whether large of small. Our <hi rendition="#u">banking facilities</hi> are virtually a <hi rendition="#u">system of currency</hi>, open to extreme expansion
                            and contraction. Its expansion within reasonable terms assists
                                nat<ex>ional</ex> progress; undue contraction of credit checks it.
                            Under law of 1844, the expansion and contraction of credit and currency
                            are made to rest chiefly upon the accidental stock of the precious
                            metals at the Bk. o. E.</p>

                                which</hi>, in fact, <hi rendition="#u">the loan had been raised by
                                the Bank</hi>. Such origin and first transaction of the B. o. E.,
                            and origin of the Gvt. Debt to the Bank, 170 years ago. This first
                            advance has never been paid off; country, through all its vicissitudes,
                            paying interest on that £1,200,000 to the present day and upon a number
                            of other loans advanced from time to time by the Bank to the Gvt.,
                            together £11,015,100, the present amount of the Gvt. Debt to the Bank.
                            Now <hi rendition="#u">all these advances or loans made</hi> by the Bk.
                            to the Gvt. were raised and made <hi rendition="#u">by the issue of
                                banknotes</hi>, which the Gvt. authorised and empowered the Bank to
                            issue, and to the validity of which the credit of the Gvt. itself has
                            always, virtually stood pledged. Without that Gvt. sanction and
                            authorisation, and the monopoly of banking and metropolitan banknote
                            issues, the Gvt. secured to the B. o. E., that establishment could not
                            have raised those amounts and <hi rendition="#u">lent</hi> them to
                            Gvt.</p>
                        <p>The Gvt. of the country was, therefore, really raising and borrowing
                            money from its own people, and upon its own credit; but through the
                            medium and instrumentality of a banker, from whom it nevertheless
                            received it as a loan, to whom accordingly it acknowledged itself
                            indebted, and to whom it has ever since paid interest upon the amount
                            for periods varying from 170 to 50 years, the last advance having been
                            made in 1816. <del rendition="#s">The Bank advanced to the Gvt

                            but remained outstanding in the hands of the public upon the credit of
                            the Bank, but virtually endorsed and guaranteed by the Gvt, down to the
                            present moment. The banknotes actually issued in the first instance,
                            have, of course, come in for payment, but they have all been paid only
                            by the issue of other banknotes for the like or other accounts, in
                            perpetual succession, and have never in any other sense been paid or
                            redeemed. The Bk. o. E. have, therefore, received 20s. in the <pb n="199"/> pound upon those notes; and the Gvt. is still liable to
                            pay them 20s. in the pound upon the whole amount, to the extent of
                            11 mill. and upwards. The country wanted 11 mill. and upwards of
                            currency beyond the „current coin of the <choice>
                                <sic>realm.“</sic>

                            </choice> in circulation, and having obtained these B. o. E. notes,
                            indirectly guaranteed by Gvt, they have constantly held and retained
                            them in circulation, and not a single note in that amount has ever been
                            paid off. The whole has remained in permanent circulation, in the hands
                            of the public until the present moment. The B. o. E. receives the
                            interest upon those 11 mill. of money to which it has no claim. The Bk.
                            can only say that they did raise and pay over to the Gvt. 11 mill. in
                            the sense as it would be true for a billbroker or commission agent to
                            say that <hi rendition="#u">he</hi> had raised and paid over the amount
                            of the bill he had negotiated for his principal. The credit of the Gvt.
                            gave the B. o. E. notes its currency and provided for its payment …
                            ensured its perpetual currency <hi rendition="#u">without payment</hi>.
                            Zudem during 20 years Bank expressly relieved by Gvt from that liability
                            to pay by a special law. Shortly after the B. o. E. note was made on <hi rendition="#u">legal tender</hi>. By this the notes placed upon a
                            par with the current coin of the realm. This entirely superseded all
                            question as to their payment or convertibility. From this moment they
                            were the inconvertible notes of the Gvt. Schon hierdurch the<hi rendition="#u"> „Gvt. Debt to the Bank“</hi>, if it had existed
                            before, was cancelled. It is true, that the Bk. is still nominally
                            liable to payment on demand. But even that <hi rendition="#u">nominal</hi> liability does not attach to the notes issued in
                            respect of these 11 mill., because they never come to the Bk., and
                            cannot come in for payment, for the most disastrous pressure has never
                            reduced the circulation so low as 11 millions, not lower than 15 or 16.
                            Why, therefore, still claims the B. o. E. to hold the Gvt. to be its
                            debtor to 11 mill. and upwards? Of the whole of that sum the B. o. E.
                            did not advance one single 6d. out of its own moneys. The whole of it
                            was raised upon its bank or promissory notes, every one of which still
                            remains, down to the present moment, wholly unpaid and unredeemed. But
                            received interest from Gvt. upon them, <hi rendition="#u">as if</hi> it
                            had really paid the whole of them. Its note circulation has never been
                            less than the Gvt. debt, but, on the contrary, it has at all times been
                            greater than that debt. The credit, which held them in continuous
                            circulation and exempted them from payment, was the Gvt. credit; and of
                            legislature Acts.</p>

                            supposed to be a gentleman „of great influence“ in certain quarters in
                            London. He conceived the idea of introducing the one to the other,
                            getting upon joint stock Co., and getting himself a handsome sum from
                            the transaction. Bernard saw Gill, represented him <pb n="200"/> the
                            mine especially rich in a species of iron called „spathose“ peculiarly
                            adapted for making steel.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear whether Carter ever authorised or empowered him to
                            sell the mine, but Bernard assured Gill that he could get a contract for
                            the sale of it. Gill thereupon saw <hi rendition="#u">Captain
                                Blakeley</hi> respecting it, and as Blakeley was largely invested in
                            the making of steel guns, and as the one of this mine was adapted for
                            the manufacture of steel by the Bessemer process, the captain readily
                            agreed to become party to the acquisition of the mine with a view to
                            forming a joint stock Co. and working it in connection with his Ordnance
                            Company. Bernard entered into a contract to sell, as the <hi rendition="#u">agent of Carter</hi>, agreed to sell the property to
                            himself and Gill for £75,000. According to Bernard, £60,000 was to be
                            paid to Carter, and 15,000 was to belong to himself. A Co. was then to
                            be formed, with a nominal capital of £250,000, and a working capital of
                            £125,000, to which Co. the promoters were to resell the mine for
                            £125,000, and thus realise a trifling profit of £50,000 for themselves.
                            The names of Blakeley and Bessemer were relied upon to float the Co., a
                            financial Co. would find the money, and, as the cost of raising the iron
                            would be only £2 p. ton, which, when converted into Steel by the
                            Bessemer process, would be worth £100 a ton, the profits of the
                            shareholders must be <hi rendition="#u">‚prodigious</hi>‘. But, when the
                            lawyers come to look into the matter, small difficulty discovered.
                            Carter not the sole owner, had not solely power to sell, had never
                            empowered Bernard to enter into contract on his behalf, and there were
                            other parties, some of them ladies, who had never been consulted on the
                            matter. Fresh negotiations for the sale of the property by <hi rendition="#u">all</hi> the parties interested at £110,000. Bernard
                            insisted now that the name of his brother Salomon should be inserted
                            into the contract with that off Gill, which Gill would not consent to.
                                Capt<ex>ain</ex> Blakeley and the Finance Co., it was said, would
                            not have anything to do with the concern until wholly in Gill’s hands.
                            Gill willing to bring out the Co. in 3 months upon 3 conditions. 1) that
                            the contract for sale be made to him; 2) ditto the negotiations for
                            resale through him; and 3) that „we shall share the profits in equal
                            moieties – half to me and the other half to you“. To these terms
                            Salomon, the brother of Bernard consented, but Bernard, the brother of
                            Salomon, refused to assert, and therefore wrote to the Finance Co. to
                            put stop to the arrangement. Gill thereupon declined to have anything
                            more to do with the matter. Nothing more of the contract of sale.
                            Nevertheless, Bernard Saloon Bernard, the plaintiff, brought action
                            against Carter to recover „the sum of £23,750 for services in connection
                            with the Perron Iron Mines“. D<ex>as</ex> Vieh was of course non-suited.

                            succeeding week, and have since been not only moderate in amount but
                            less than the current receipts of gold and silver bullion from
                            Australia.“ In other words, the specie drain from the U. St. to Europe
                            has been checked by the changes in the price on gold, which on 5 June
                            was 146, and on 5 July 153%. A fluctuation of 7% apparently separates
                            the two periods – one of efflux, the other of stagnation – with no
                            contraction of notes, no action on prices, and no parliamentary or other
                            generalship to balk the enemy. The recent specie movement from the
                            U. St. dates from 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> May. On that date, it
                            may be fairly assumed, the first notes of alarm were sounded in private
                            letters from England. But the U. States Treasury was then well stocked
                            with specie. So that 35 Mill. dollars were thrown on the market, in
                            response to the demand. Parting with that sum, the U. States
                                Treas<ex>ury</ex> withdrew from the „Gold room“ and left the
                            continuing wants of commerce to be provided on the usual terms of demand
                            and supply. From 125<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>, at the opening of the „gold-room“ on May 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi>, the price was carried to 168<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> on June 18, to
                            recede, however, as stated, to 153 on 6. July. Thus the precious Metals
                            were acted on in the U. St. as mere articles of commerce. Prohibitory
                            Acts, <hi rendition="#u">1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi></hi> passed by
                                <hi rendition="#u">State of New York</hi> (Feb. 18, 1863) prohibited
                            loans on gold coin or bullion, <hi rendition="#u">2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi></hi>, <hi rendition="#u">passed by Congress</hi>,
                            (March 3, 1863) restricted the sale and price of gold; the <hi rendition="#u">3<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi></hi>, passed <hi rendition="#u">by Congress</hi> (June 17, 1864) absolutely
                            prohibited in certain cases the sale of gold. It so defeated its
                            intended object, that formally repeated on <hi rendition="#u">2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> July</hi>, 1864, 15 days only after its
                            enactment.) At no period whatever have banknotes and coin in the U. St.
                            stood in anything like the relation maintained in this country. So,
                            obviously, <hi rendition="#u">the exchanges control themselves in the
                                U. St.</hi> The <hi rendition="#u">banking in New York has</hi> been
                            deliberately accepted by the Congress as the model for the <hi rendition="#u">national banking system</hi>.</p>

                        <head>Requirements Demand for Money and Demand for Capital.</head>
                        <p>An increase of the monetary requirements of the country is by no means
                            synonymous with an increased demand for capital. The former does often
                            coexist with a decrease in the demand for capital. Notably during every
                            commercial crisis (sc. panic). When large failures or suspensions take
                            place, demand f<ex>ür</ex> capital diminishes, demand for currency
                            increases. These events diminish the amount of business, hence for <hi rendition="#u">the use of capital on loan</hi>. The suspended firms
                            cease business, the distrust occasioned induces other forms to contract
                            their operations. Hence demand for capital lessened. But the monetary
                            requirements of the commercial classes increase. <hi rendition="#u">Bills</hi>, by means of which trade is carried on, become
                            temporarily distrusted. The bills of all merchants connected in business
                            mit d<ex>en</ex> suspended firms are locked upon with distrust both by
                            the banks and by the public. The parties dealing with such firms <hi rendition="#u">refuse to accept bills</hi> from them and require
                            payment in banknotes. Hence <hi rendition="#u">increased supply of
                                banknotes required</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">although the ordinary
                                amount of business is diminished</hi>. But such increase of
                            banknotes only to be obtained from the B. o. E. But when <hi rendition="#u">increased demand for its notes</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">Bank raises the rate of discount</hi>. Legal limit of
                            notes, decrease of reserves points to the approximation to that limit.
                            Hence raising of rate of discount. The Bank says not: „we cannot lend so
                            much capital“; it <choice>
                                <sic>say:</sic>
                                <corr cert="high">says:</corr>
                            </choice> „we have not enough of notes wherewith to transfer the
                            capital“ to make the loans. Thus <hi rendition="#u">rate of interest
                                rises contemporaneously with a diminished demand for capital
                                throughout the country</hi>. Every rise in the rate of discount
                            depresses the markets, at once <hi rendition="#u">depreciating the value
                                of goods of all kinds</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">still further
                                contracting credit</hi>. Hence failures and suspensions multiply,
                            and, with every new failure, bills become more distrusted, and banknotes
                            are more called for in payment. Another diminution in the Bank reserve
                            of notes, up again goes the rate of discount. Thus a momentary
                            commercial difficulty aggravated into a serious crisis, mercantile firms
                            go down in scores, the trade of the country is immensely diminished, 10

                            natural course of things, and made the rate of interest to depend, not

                            of the laws for which they were in no way accountable.“ A 10% tax, he
                            said, meant a tax <hi rendition="#u">of more than double the annual

                            There are those who say that the money that there is in the country

                            of the Bank itself. If the doors of the Banking Department were once
                            closed, as they would have been but for the suspension of the Act, how
                            long does Gladstone inquire it would have taken to exhaust the gold in
                            the issue department? When the 10 or 12 mill. of gold withdrawn, there
                            would still be 14 mill. of notes to come in for gold, and there would be
                            no gold to meet them. And the Bankact has <hi rendition="#u">preserved</hi> the Banknote!</p>

                        <p>Estimated by both tests, at least <hi rendition="#sup">9</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">10</hi> of that large portion of English commerce,
                            settled by London bankers is performed by methods of currency other than
                            banknotes and coin. The <hi rendition="#u">Country clearing</hi>,
                            established by Lubbock, <pb n="210"/> belongs only to a particular class
                            of country bankers. To use Lubbock’s words „the country banker ‚A‘
                            receiving a cheque drawn on another country Banker ‚B‘, sent the cheque
                            by post direct to ‚B‘. B then requested C, his banker in London to pay
                            the amount to D, the London correspondent of A.“ In <hi rendition="#u">1858</hi> Lubbock thought that the complication of this system
                            might be avoided by the <hi rendition="#u">establishment of a central
                                office in London</hi>, for the special purpose of clearing country
                            cheques, established in <hi rendition="#u">November</hi> (1858) the
                            Country Clearing H<ex>ouse</ex> at London. But this economy does not yet
                            attach to a very large proportion of provincial business. Liverpool
                            should have its own Clearing House, for cheques and bills between
                            Liverpool bankers, so should Manchester, Glasgow etc. The requirements
                            of banknotes whereby commerce is expressed has been gradually reduced,
                            relatively to the magnitude of our commerce, by the banking facilities
                            we have described. If our commerce depended, in fact, at this moment,
                            upon banknotes as much as in 1844, when Peel’s Act passed, it would be
                            simply extinguished.</p>

                            made upon him. The defendant pleaded that he had been induced to become
                            a shareholder by the fraud and misrepresentations of the plaintiff … The
                            Co. formed in June last for the working of a coal and iron mine. In
                            prospectus stated that the estimated quantity of coal in the mine was
                            7,000,000 tons, that the value of the mine was £48,000, that the
                            probable actual produce of coal would be 93,000 tons; the annual profit
                            upon the coal £14,000 and upon the iron £12,700; minimum dividend 10%,
                            payable halfyearly.“ These representations false and fraudulent.
                            According to the report of a committee of inquiry, quantity of coal only
                            1,500,000 tons; the <hi rendition="#u">coal</hi> not worth the cost of
                            raising, or at best inconsiderable profit; no profit to be made <hi rendition="#u">upon the iron</hi>, consequently impossible these
                            could be any dividend payable to the shareholders. The defendant called
                            evidence on those points, also showed that <hi rendition="#u">£10,000</hi> had been paid to the attorneys for getting up the Co;
                            that the whole concern was enormously in debt, and in fact insolvent;
                            the only parties who had derived any benefit from the Co. were the
                            attorneys and their friends, the directors; that <hi rendition="#u">„dummy“</hi> shareholders had been got up to a large amount; and
                            that by such means the shares had been worked up to a fictitious value
                            when in fact and reality they were worth nothing whatever. Of course

                            Co. A Mr. Baylis, who had been managing director, had got £1000 a year.
                            Another director (auch evidence für d<ex>ie</ex> Co) was compelled to
                            admit that he had also received £200 from somebody, though „he declared

                            received, yet gain on the years’ transactions of nearly £10000. The

                            easy, when bad, very difficult or impossible. <hi rendition="#u">Laing</hi>, when chairm<ex>an</ex> of the Brighton Co., attempted
                            to correct the evil by giving a higher rate of interest for long term of
                            years; but longdated debentures may fall due on bad times, even if the
                            periods of their renewal are less frequent. Then arose the <hi rendition="#u">notion of debenture stock</hi> (originated with the
                            Bristol and Exeter Co) whereby the debenture debt virtually converted

                            extent. With all this, the amount of railway debentures payable at fixed

                            from which we are now emerging, has been a grievous source of difficulty
                            and discredit. Debenture stocks are generally at a discount, and the

                            Average in England sind:</p>
                        <p>1) <hi rendition="#u">Large Increase in Engl<ex>ish</ex> Trade:</hi>
                            <hi rendition="#u">1849 Exports:</hi> £63 Mill., <hi rendition="#u">1865</hi> £165,860,000 <hi rendition="#u">1854. Imports:</hi>
                            152£ Mill. <hi rendition="#u">1865.</hi> 271,000,000. <hi rendition="#u">Shipping</hi> has increased in the same proportion. Levi forgets,
                            that with this increase of trade, concurrent increase in profit, wealth
                            and amount of <hi rendition="#u">loanable capital</hi>. D<ex>ie</ex>
                            Advocates of the Bank Act say, that an increase of trade necessitates
                                <hi rendition="#u">no increase of currency</hi>, but only <hi rendition="#u">an increase of capital</hi>. In one sense they are
                            right. The same amount of currency will be sufficient, if <hi rendition="#u">currency eked out by an expansion of credit</hi>, and
                            the <hi rendition="#u">holders of „loanable capital“</hi> be thereby
                            enabled <hi rendition="#u">to command higher rates of discount for the
                                temporary use of it</hi>. That is the object of the arbitrary
                            limitation upon the banknote issues, and it has answered, as shown by
                            the higher average rate, and the extreme fluctuations. As to the <hi rendition="#u">increase of trade per se</hi>, so French trade in
                            last 20 years increased in the same proportion. Dennoch in France 4%,
                            while in England 10%, in France now 3, while in England 6%.</p>
                        <p>2) <hi rendition="#u">Annual Export of precious metals for the East.</hi>

                            did not return, but we obtained, in exchange for it, something else,
                            which we exported to other countries for equal or greater amount of
                            silver and gold, and, therefore, the temporary abstraction of those
                            amounts will not account for a permanent rise.</p>
                        <p>3) <hi rendition="#u">Immense Number of Joint Stock Cos:</hi> In <hi rendition="#u">1864 and 1865</hi> were <hi rendition="#u">832Cos.</hi> formed m<ex>it</ex> authorised capital of

                            in public works. But, the capital of a Joint Stock Co. is not so much
                            capital taken out of the country, nor so much currency taken out of
                            circulations; it is only so much money transferred from the names of the
                            respective subscribers to it, at their bankers, to the credit of the Co.
                            as <hi rendition="#u">their</hi> bankers. The formation of a new joint
                            stock Co., and the aggregation of their capital, differs in no material
                            respects, from the formation of a new firm of bankers, merchants, or
                            traders, and the combinations of their capitals.</p>

                        <p>If we look to our legislation and administration, as affecting national
                            defense, national finance, army and navy, Bk. o. E., railways etc, in
                            all we shall see the same lamentable indications of utter incapacity.
                            The „ruling families“ have lost the art of ruling, and the leading
                                polit<ex>ical</ex> parties the art of legislating and governing.</p>
                        <p>Besides the great leading parties of Liberal and Conservative, which
                            manage to impede and obstruct all legislation on general topics, the
                            House is split up into smaller sections, representing the particular
                            rights of some private interest, which in general means some special
                            wrong affecting the public interest. We have the great landed interest,
                            and the Church party, the Irish party, and the railway interest, and the
                            banking interest, and the director interest – comprising the directors

                            protect the public against their wrong doings. We have a deficient
                            watersupply in India, and a defective water supply in London; both
                            urgent evils for years, remain urgent evils, and in consequence we have

                            from the foul and pestilent water supplied by unscrupulous water Cos. in
                            London. We want roads and railroads and canals for transit and for
                            irrigation in India, and we have been spending millions of money to
                            obtain them, but we have not obtained them, nevertheless. Our army and
                            navy the most costly in the world, and yet we have scarcely a ship to
                            send to sea to impede the passage of an invader. Sir John Pakington, one
                            of the great mismanagers startled the H. o. C. by telling us that,
                            although we have been spending 10 mill. a year for the last 10 years, we
                            have no naval reserve nor ships sufficient to relieve the vessels coming
                            home from foreign stations.“ „There is“, says Mr. Scholefield, „an

                            1706 to present time, with single exception of 1708, when it was 12<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>% p. a., the
                            dividend had never exceeded 11% p. a., and for many years not 4<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi>%. If the
                            industrious classes have lost a million, the Bankproprietors have gained
                            it; but what of that? „they are both citizens of the same country.“
                            Ausser d<ex>er</ex> Bk. o. E., other lenders gained many millions; but
                            the sum total of these gains falls very short of the sum total of losses
                            incurred. These „variations in the currency“, and the <hi rendition="#u">transfer of these few millions</hi> involve <hi rendition="#u">the
                                depreciation and destruction of property to the amount of 100<hi rendition="#sup">dns</hi> of millions</hi>. As these
                            „variations“ the result of an artificial and unjust law, they are <hi rendition="#u">„gigantic robberies“</hi>. The plan (by Hubbard) of
                            common citizenship would be as good in the mouth of the pickpocket and
                            the burglar. The plundered and the plunderers are in both cases citizens
                            of the same country.</p>

                            cannot be realised in time of need – that is, the borrowers of deposits
                            bound themselves to pay principal on demand or at fixed dates, and
                            employed that principal in securities which either were not worth the

                            <p>Here is an absolute loss to shareholders of nearly 8 millions, and
                                they have still much more to pay. Yet, <hi rendition="#u">there is
                                    not one of these Cos. that did not either spring from private
                                    undertaking of reputed wealth and prosperity</hi>, or commenced
                                business under favourable circumstances. The distress which followed
                                the railway mania of 1845 and 1846 was intense, and, whatever the
                                amount of calls paid, it was, for the time, swept away in
                                depreciated market value; but these calls were represented by <hi rendition="#u">some</hi> value; there was the freehold of the
                                land, upon which the rails were laid, and the rails, the lodgings,
                                and a certain monopoly of traffick which must belong to every
                                railway. But <hi rendition="#u">in this share crisis of 1866 the
                                    money called up under liquidation</hi> is utterly lost to the
                                contributories. It all goes to pay for losses which can never be
                                recovered, and against which there is no asset. It is gone, too, in
                                several cases, to <hi rendition="#u">pay losses long concealed, and
                                    artfully made to wear the aspect of gains</hi>, or almost
                                wilfully contracted by reckless management. The share <hi rendition="#mMM">crisis of 1866 is, therefore, peculiarly
                                    disheartening, u<ex>nd</ex> daher <hi rendition="#u">all</hi>
                                    new shares distrusted. If the Rothschilds, the Barings, and the

                                    subscribers. <hi rendition="#u">The share of such conversions
                                        has been too palpable</hi>, and the heavy blow under which
                                    credulous shareholders now suffer has been too stirring for

                            therefrom. Article – cotton 4 years ago only 4 to 5d. p. lb. – rose
                            gradually to 4 or 5 × this value. India was the English participator in

                            or country. One of the <hi rendition="#u">first applications of this
                                superabundant capital was to manufacture banking and finance
                                Cos</hi> of every possible character and name, and to work with the

                            render them unproductive. The native disposition for speculation and
                            restless trading has lasted too long, and is too well known to be
                            wondered at. Aber leading European merchants enroll themselves as
                            directors of speculative land and finance Cos., managers and other
                            officers of banks give up their appointments to take part in such
                            concerns, and banks spring up in connection with them for the purposes
                            of making advances on their shares. A Gvt bank even is tempted to depart
                            from the rigid conditions of its charter to foster such unsound and
                            hasardous schemes.</p>
                        <p>The banks which have held their ground have had severe trials to pass
                            through, and having losses to contend against, consequent upon the
                            failure of many East India houses long established, of high character
                            and credit. Indian banking has its seasons of profitable opportunity, as
                            well as drawbacks and disadvantages. A bank, with its head office and
                            board of directors in London, cannot be alive at the moment to what is
                            going on at a distance of 10,000 or 15,000 miles; much to be left to the
                            executive on the spot, which, in many of the bank branches, consists of
                            an inexperienced, <choice>
                                <sic>halddespotic</sic>

                            </choice> manager. Much must <supplied cert="high">be</supplied> left to
                            their judgment and discretion. Then, nearly all our enterprising men who
                            have founded and successfully managed Indian banks, want to return as
                            soon as possible home. No sooner a bank set up in Bombay or Calcutta
                            bidding fair to become a prosperous concern when it must have its head
                            office established in London, and run away, as it were, from the most
                            important part of its business and most legitimate sphere of operation.
                            A tempting salary is held out as the London manager’s income. An
                            influential board of directors has to be got together at London, and
                            attractive place of business rented or purchased.</p>

                            shareholders by the expectation that on their part no further advance
                            would be required; 2) by the unpaid reserve to afford a ground of

                            and drops lower day by day. <pb n="225"/> Simultaneously, another
                            process commences. As the value of the shares drops, the depositors and
                            customers become alarmed. As fast as they withdraw their money the
                            shares decline lower and lower, till the final catastrophe arrives. In
                            some cases, such was the alarm which the mere idea of raising more
                            capital excited, that it became impossible to make a call, however
                            imperatively required, the directors avowing that, by such a course,
                            more money would be frightened away, on the one hand, than obtained, on
                            the other. Where, then, to these Cos. the advantage of the uncalled
                            margin? It has only been prejudicial to the shareholder. Depositor,
                            perhaps secured from ultimate loss, but the long delay of liquidation

                        <p>There have been concealment, frauds and misrepresentations. The public
                            would never have become shareholders, if they had <hi rendition="#u">even suspected</hi> the true state of the affairs at the time of
                            the transfer. The old firm was at that time absolutely and irretrievably
                            insolvent; it was worth several mill. St. less than nothing; for several
                            years it had carried on business without any profit, at a very heavy
                            annual loss; a large proportion of the <hi rendition="#u">assets</hi>
                            they had to transfer was composed of the <hi rendition="#u">fictitious
                                debts of bankrupts and insolvents and men of straw</hi>. The public
                            believed, and were induced to believe by the prospectus, that the old
                            concern prosperous; the goodwill cheap at <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> mill. St.; and that, after
                            paying that price, the business was such „in the opinion of the
                            directors could not fail to insure a highly remunerative return to the
                            shareholders“. The shareholders are now seeking to be relieved from the
                            liabilities they incurred. Contracts obtained by frauds and false
                            representations not binding in equity. The Co. failed in May. Till now
                            (October) the official liquidators did not disclose the true state of
                            things, although this a necessary preliminary <hi rendition="#u">before
                                settling the list of contributors</hi>. These official liquidators
                            appointed as their solicitors, and, until within the last few days, have
                            been acting under the legal advice of the firm who were the solicitors

                        <p>Not even the „unprotected female“ so helpless as jointstock cos. <hi rendition="#u">shareholders</hi>. Greedy and unscrupulous <hi rendition="#u">promoters</hi> dig their pitfalls and lay their traps

                            their cupidity and self-seeking, may please. The shrewdest adept in
                            „artful dodging“ and „hocuss-pocussing“ is generally made the <hi rendition="#u">chairman and spokesman</hi> of the board; or a tinsel
                            lord „in need of tin“ … is caught and put in the chair to keep the
                            turbulent shareholders in order, and by timely address to repress any
                            rising disposition to make impertinent questions about the business of
                            the Co. or the proceedings of the board. <hi rendition="#u">Clever
                                managers</hi> conceal the true position of the co. in mystifying and
                            unmeaning reports or unintelligible balance-sheets, and <hi rendition="#u">accommodating auditors</hi> are very ready to certify
                            that „all is right“ and perfectly satisfactory. At the public meetings
                            of the Co. every shareholder who attends is expected to „conduct himself
                            as a gentleman“; and then he learns that to be a gent<ex>leman</ex> he
                            must be silent, submissive, and confiding, and that the most
                            ungentlemanly conduct of which anyone can be guilty is to exhibit a
                            curious or distrustful disposition, or to put obtrusive questions about
                            the business of the Co., or the conduct or management of the honourable
                            board. The <hi rendition="#u">shareholder</hi> knows nothing of the <hi rendition="#u">secret articles and private arrangements made with
                                the promoters of the Co.</hi>, and he wants to know 50 other things
                            about its origin, progress, and prospect, but he must not inquire about
                            them. They are all matters in the hands of „the board“, and sure to
                            receive their best consideration. He must be content, therefore, with
                            such information as the board may vouchsafe to give him, and the board
                            takes care to give him as little as possible. If the shareholder becomes
                            urgent he is treated as rude. The chairman rises with dignity, and asks
                            if the hon<ex>ourable</ex> gent<ex>leman</ex> means to insinuate etc, or
                            means to impute etc, and he is expected to shake in his shoes when told
                            that the board would feel compelled to regard his motion as a vote of
                            censure or of want of confidence. If he should not be sufficiently awed
                            by this threat, there are 20 hands in the meeting ready to „bonnet“ him,
                            or to „shut him up“ by some other summary process, lest his impertinent
                            inquiries should lead to <hi rendition="#u">impolitic disclosures and
                                unfavourable rumours which might damage the property of the
                                shareholders in the market</hi>. If he goes to the offices of the
                            Co, he is probably snubbed by a supercilious manager, a flippant
                            secretary, or an impudent clerk. <hi rendition="#u">They</hi> are the
                            humble servants or subservient tools of the <hi rendition="#u">magnificent board</hi>, <hi rendition="#u">he</hi> is <hi rendition="#u">only one</hi> of the shareholders. <hi rendition="#mMM">It may be true that the board, the manger, the
                                officials, and the Co. itself are but the <hi rendition="#u">creatures of the shareholders; but all power and authority are

                        <p>The general result of all this is, that the great body of j. st. co.

                            funds. A comparatively small number amongst them, who occupy the
                            position of directors, <hi rendition="#u">arrogate to themselves the
                                entire management</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">exercise a virtually
                                irresponsible power and authority over the whole</hi>. The
                            consequence, in but too many lamentable instances – grossest
                            mismanagement, most unscrupulous perversion of the funds to other
                            purposes than the proper business of the Co., most reckless jobbing and
                            extravagant expenditure, and an almost <hi rendition="#u">total
                                subordination of the property and interests of the shareholders to
                                the primary objects and designs of the directors and their
                                associates</hi>. Hence the scandalous disclosures brought to light
                            by the failure of the <hi rendition="#u">Joint-Stock-Discount-Co</hi>,
                            in which the directors had recklessly misappropriated <hi rendition="#u">the capital which the shareholders had subscribed for the

                        <p>The Americ<ex>an</ex> civil war raised the price of cotton, shut up the
                            Lancashire mills, starved the Lancash<ex>ire</ex> operatives, caused a
                                <hi rendition="#u">huge speculation</hi>, and prodigious drain of
                            the precious metals from Gr. Brit., gave a vast National Debt to U. St.
                            – and it has given to <hi rendition="#u">British India a new commercial
                                existence</hi>. Our high prices great incentive to Indian cotton
                            production. Bombay, the great centre of cotton dealing in India, with
                            such comparatively small aid as the railways terminating at Bombay now
                            confer, made huge fortunes upon the opportunity, and then Bombay lost
                            much of what had been made. … Bombay and India have found a great
                            necessity in Liverpool and Manchester … .</p>
                        <p>The <hi rendition="#u">great speculation at Bombay</hi> began in the 2<hi rendition="#sup">n</hi>d year of the American war when the
                            Lancashire spinners were fairly roused to a true appreciation of their
                            position and their pressing wants. Our high prices and our urgent needs
                            gave <hi rendition="#u">fabulous profits to the intermediate traders
                                between the ryot producer, and the Manchester consumer, and Bombay
                                and Liverpool grew nominally rich</hi>. Here (England) not only the
                            cotton speculation, but speculation in various other forms ran riot, and
                            collapse has followed.</p>
                        <p>At <hi rendition="#u">Bombay</hi>, relatively to the population, the
                            mania set on foot by our cotton wants was of giant proportions compared
                            to our own. <hi rendition="#u">Finance Cos., Banking Cos., Reclamation
                                Cos.</hi>, sent for their shares by the million to eager all others,
                            and the quantities of shares, the premiums, and the scale of apparent
                            gains <hi rendition="#u">during 3 years</hi> dwarfed our own experience
                            of such matters into insignificance. One poor Gvt. Clerc won
                            2 millions £ in a few months. Other poor Gvt. Clercs became great
                            directors and financiers, with millions upon millions under their
                            control. Even the <hi rendition="#u">poor ryot</hi>, who always had
                            lived from hand to mouth, and could never raise a crop without the aid
                            of the money lender, bought his horses and his vehicles, and loaded
                            himself and his belongings with costly jewels and ornaments of the
                            precious metals. His crops bought and the money paid almost as soon as
                            he sowed the seed. For fully 3 years we have paid little short of a 100
                            millions a year for raw cotton, and our Board of Trade returns show us
                            that about <hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> of
                            that supply came from Brit<ex>ish</ex> India, which in effect signifies
                            Bombay.</p>
                        <pb n="228"/>
                        <p>The <hi rendition="#u">collapse</hi> came of course. With it, Bombay
                            speculators who had been millionaires in name failed <hi rendition="#u">en masse</hi>, together with the banks, and the finance, and all
                            other cos. <hi rendition="#u">Western India</hi> is clearly roused from
                            the lethargy of centuries. <hi rendition="#mMM">The Parsee and Hindoo
                                are, after the cotton mania, more productive beings than they were,
                                and have learnt to be producers, not alone for immediate wants, as
                                of old, but to supply the wants of other nations.</hi></p>
                        <p>Wilson saw that railways India’s greatest need, and forthwith drew up
                            that agreement between the State and the railway cos., which has
                            inaugurated a railway system in India.</p>
                        <p><hi rendition="#u">Bombay</hi> is built on a narrow <hi rendition="#u">peninsula joined to the mainland by a still narrower isthmus</hi>,
                            which, combined, constitutes one side of the spacious harbour. The
                            commerce of the place is at present conducted in what is called <hi rendition="#u">„The Fort“</hi> and, in a word, the commerce of the
                            few narrow streets of the Fort of Bombay is the commerce of Western
                            India. The shipping discharge their cargoes in the Bay into lighters,
                            and again discharge them at the wharves, which are inadequate for the
                            trade. The only extension of Bombay possible is either by building
                            beyond the isthmus on the mainland, or by filling in shallow portions of
                            the harbour for the erection of warehouses and wharves; and it is the
                            supply of these pressing necessities which has called forth the various
                            reclamation projects in which so much money has been won and lost. The
                            reclamation of the waste lands in the harbour of Bombay is, therefore, a
                            great want, with corresponding profits, if judiciously executed.</p>

                            Investors some months back sold Consols and Exchequer Bills, and all the
                            good prudent things, and bought finance and bank share and almost any
                            „limited“ shares which appeared to promise fabulous rates of interest
                            upon the purchase prices. There was, for a time, a vision of sudden
                            wealth which a few months have utterly destroyed. As a rule, the mania
                            in other shares has extended to railways. Even now, the minimum both of
                            dividend and market value has not yet been attained in a number of
                            cases. For the time very little railway debenture money is forthcoming
                            from the public, as the overdrawn balances at the bankers show in the
                            lately published accounts; and it seems quite a question whether, in
                            some instances, revenue will not be absorbed to meet capital engagements
                            in the absence of that constant supply of capital upon debentures.</p>
                        <p>There is little field for speculation except Indian and Colonial Railway
                            Shares, and U. States Stock.</p>

                            made the following statement: „It is evident that no accounts of the
                            half year, which did not terminate until 4 January 1846, could have been
                            completed by the 22<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi> Dec. 1845 … when the
                            accounts were made up in accordance with the books, they did not show
                            that any such dividend had been earned; and, in order to justify the
                            foregone conclusion of the Board, the <hi rendition="#u">traffick
                                accounts were altered</hi>, and the expenses squared to suit the
                            dividend, not the dividend to suit the expenses.“</p>
                        <p><hi rendition="#u">Again, in April 1849</hi>, the assistant accountant of
                            the <hi rendition="#u">Eastern Counties Co</hi> declared „it was a

                        <p>Again, there was traffic manager of the <hi rendition="#u">Eastern
                                Counties Co</hi> who took the half years’ account ended 4 July,
                            1848, to <hi rendition="#u">Hudson</hi> at Albertgate, and who stated to
                            the Committee of Investigation: „Mr. Hudson directed me to tell them at
                            the office to carry £10,000 to the ensuing half-year; that is to say to
                            make the expenditure in the printed report appear to be £10,000 less
                            than was actually incurred.“</p>

                            secretary, wrote to Hodgson on 21. Febr. 1866, that the members of the

                        <p>„As to the <hi rendition="#u">knowledge</hi> of the Finance Committee, a

                            would be more dangerous. I think they know quite enough.“ They were thus
                            designedly kept in the dark.</p>
                        <p>„Keep their eyes bandaged, Martin“, was the memorable trust committed by
                            one chairman of the <hi rendition="#u">South Eastern

                            shareholders should not understand the position of their property, but
                            that hardly comes up to this bandaging of the Finance Committee of the

                        <p>Other parallel between the administrations of Hudson and Hodgson. They
                            both have had a <hi rendition="#u">remarkable propensity for leases,
                                amalgamations, and extensions</hi>. In <hi rendition="#u">Hudson’s</hi> case the <hi rendition="#u">personal motive</hi> was
                            apparent enough. The Bristol and Birmingham, the Leeds and Bradford, the
                            Great Northern of England, and the New Castle and Berwick, and the Hull
                            and Selly, were all leased and amalgamated with at, perhaps, <hi rendition="#u">3 or 4 times their value</hi>; but, if so, the
                            enhanced value of the lease or amalgamation went to someone. Mr. Hudson
                            himself was found tolerably well charged with the shares in most of
                            these good things before any lease or amalgamation was contemplated,
                            excepting by himself.</p>

                            capital of 1 million; it is now a system of 781 miles open for traffic,
                                u<ex>nd</ex> 147 miles partly under construction, with an authorised
                            share and loan capital of £22,210,713. The Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee
                            have been absorbed, ditto Edinburgh and Glasgow, and other lines, and

                            yet the outlay was to have been made in the interest of some one, by

                            were once as high as 115. Why have they fallen to 88£, their present
                            price? There has never been any doubt as to a dividend; on the contrary,
                                <hi rendition="#u">to the everlasting Credit of the Russians</hi>,
                            the dividends were punctually paid even during the Crimean war. The
                            reason is this, that <hi rendition="#u">from 1850 Russia has been
                                continually borrowing</hi>, and instead of the one Five P. Ct. Loan
                            of 1822, we have now no less than 5 other Russian stocks quoted on the
                            London Stock Exchange! The same may be said of the Brazilian, Ejyptian,
                            Peruvian, and Turkish bonds.</p>
                        <p>If this Russ<ex>ian</ex> Loan be floated at 86, what security is there
                            that another will not be introduced next year at 80? And so from time to
                            time are existing interests deteriorated. An attempt was made not long
                            ago by Mssrs. Barings to introduce a Six p. Ct. Loan for the Argentine
                            Republic at 75, when Buenos Ayres Six P. Ct. were at about 88. What was
                            the consequence? Down went the price of the latter stock, because there
                            was a rush to sell by subscribers to the new loans; but, after all, it
                            proved to be a failure, and but a small portion of it could be floated.
                            … It is not the thing for any State to come to us for new Loans whilst
                            their old debts are below the prices at which they were issued, and it
                            is too bad to seek to borrow on terms <hi rendition="#u">below the
                                market value</hi> of bonds of former loans, as it the case now with
                            Russia.</p>

                            yet, so thoroughly the basis of public confidence sapped, that prices
                            (on Stock etc Share markets) without any sign of animation. Dullness and
                            distrust prevail, in face of the fact that the Board of Trade returns
                            show the commerce of the country in more active condition than is
                            generally believed. Holders of money are afraid – afraid, at least of
                            all the old channels of investment, and capital is only to be tempted
                            for the moment by <hi rendition="#u">foreign</hi> or <hi rendition="#u">colonial</hi> loan. Of this the <hi rendition="#u">enormous

                            interest shall make itself sufficiently felt to force into employment
                            the unremunerative loans which are now accumulated in bankers’

                            due … Its introduction has had the effect, not only of checking the
                            rise, which was general, in all foreign stocks, but of causing a fall in
                            Consols, and <hi rendition="#u">a fall of 2 to 3% in all classes of

                            by large and injudicious loans, and then, by suddenly calling them in,
                            produced a panic, a fall in the prices of all commodities, and serious
                            losses to the whole commercial community“. In illustration he mentions,
                            that in 1836 Bullion of the Bank reduced to 4 Mill. St., whilst its
                            circulation and deposits 30 Mill. £. To replenish their stock of gold, a
                            course of restriction was commenced, resulting in panic of 1837, by
                            which losses of capital in the 5 great staples of cotton, woolen, silk,
                            linen, and hardware, estimated at 40 Mill. £. The same thing occurred in

                            was passed, but, says Smith „22 years have since elapsed, – and the

                            50 p. ct. p. a. on their respective capitals. Smith utterly fails to
                            show that the large deposits in the Joint Stock Banks, or the amount of
                            their reserves had anything whatever to do with the last crises. But

                        <p>The old firm saw ruin imminent, and they seriously set themselves to the
                            task of averting the dreadful catastrophe. They had already wasted a
                            great part of their own fortunes, and squandered in foolish speculation
                            3 millions of other people’s money; what were they to do? Craft and
                            subtlety were to be employed to stave off the evil. Their own firm was
                            ruined, but their <hi rendition="#u">name</hi> was still a potent spell,
                            and that they believed they could persuade a credulous public to buy and
                            so to save themselves. That by this process they might bring ruin upon
                            thousands of helpless innocent people was apparently of no consideration
                            to these „<hi rendition="#u">pious</hi> bankrupts in fortune and in
                            honor“. They determined to obtain for themselves a large sum for their
                            name and their goodwill, and then to transfer all liabilities to the <choice>
                                <sic>new.</sic>

                            </choice> Co. To do this the public had to be deceived „and this was

                                would have brought to the gallows the perpetrators of the

                            for whose business they engaged to give £500,000. The public were
                            cajoled into buying shares in a concern utterly bankrupt by persons
                            thoroughly cognisant of the <pb n="238"/> fraud they were committing.
                            The <hi rendition="#u">private arrangement</hi> (<hi rendition="#u">secret</hi> article) contained a full description of the actual
                            state of the old firm, and set forth in „damning figures“ all the
                            liabilities and debts of the bankrupt sellers. Who, asks Justitia, are
                            the criminals? The members of the old firm and the directors of the new
                            Co. They concocted and executed the whole scheme, etc. „These“, he says,
                            „are the criminals, and their crime is that of obtaining money under
                            false and fraudulent pretenses – or swindling – and for that they ought
                            to be placed on the criminal charge at the bar of the Old Bailey.“</p>

                            result of the opposite extreme. Too much confidence – undue inflation of
                            credit – invariably followed by distrust, but in all cases there must be
                            one immediate cause – one culminating point – which precedes the crises.
                                <hi rendition="#u">Before the panic of 1847</hi> great railway mania
                            which necessitated money borrowing to an extreme extent, then panic,
                            with the attendant export of precious metals to buy food, which was the
                            immediate cause of suspension of Peel’s Act. <hi rendition="#u">Before

                            extended to this country, and the immediate cause of the suspension of
                            the Bank Act then was the failure of various banks and colossal
                            commercial houses connected with the American trade. <hi rendition="#u">Before the panic of 1866</hi>, great speculation in cotton, finance

                            of <hi rendition="#u">Overend etc</hi>, 11 May, necessitating for 3<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi> time the suspension of Peel’s Act.</p>
                        <p>Fowler so far right, but fool when asserting: that the B. o. E. was
                            prepared for the emergency because the Act of 1844 had compelled her to
                            take the utmost caution in the management of her business, and that, <hi rendition="#u">guiding herself, by the state of her reserve, she
                                maintained the high rate of interest which counteracted an adverse
                                tendency in the foreign exchanges</hi>.</p>
                        <p>1) As to the necessity for a high rate of interest as a means of
                            retaining gold in the country and of counteracting adverse foreign
                            exchanges … B. o. E. minimum rate of discount <hi rendition="#u">10%
                                from 12 May to 15 Aug.</hi>, and in that interval the Bank increased
                            its stock of coin and bullion from less than 13 to less than 14 mill. In
                            the same interval the B. o. F. minimum rate from 3 to 4%, but its stock
                            of coin and bullion increased in those 3 eventful months from 20<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> to 29<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> mill. Ten %
                            brought the B. o. E. virtually no gold at all; 3 and 4% brought the Bank
                            of Fr<ex>ance</ex> nearly 9 mill. <hi rendition="#u">From 15 Aug. to now
                                (15 Dec.)</hi> the minimum bankrate of disc<ex>ount</ex> at the
                            B. o. E. reduced from 10 to 4%, and from about 14 mill. on 15. Aug.
                            B. o. E. holds now 18 mill. It is clear that a high interest does not
                            always attract gold; and that, after the panic of last May, it was <hi rendition="#u">worse</hi> than inoperative. It was mischievous to
                            all but the B. o. E. and some other banks. Rest and dividends of
                            B. o. E. good.</p>
                        <pb n="239"/>
                        <p>2) Old, old theory that „the convertibility of the note“ scared by 10%
                            rate for 3 months, that the 10% kept enough gold, and that
                            convertibility was never in danger. Nonsense! <hi rendition="#u">The
                                convertibility was more in danger from the 10% than from any other
                                cause</hi>. Was the convertibility of the Fr<ex>ench</ex> note in
                            danger from 3 to 4% while ours was 10; or with 30 mill. of gold to back
                            it, while B. o. E. could not get half the amount with 10%. If from
                            12 May to 15 Aug. the B. o. E. had acted up to the letter of the law, it
                            must have stopped payment. And then the convertibility of the Note went
                            to the wall. It was only by throwing the Act of 1844 overboard that the
                            Convertibility of the note was preserved.</p>
                        <p>3) Fowler tells that there must be <hi rendition="#u">a limitation of
                                notes</hi>, and that the power of relaxation must rest with the
                            minister of the day. Where existed the power of limitation in the recent
                            crisis? Country bankers <hi rendition="#u">would</hi> have <hi rendition="#u">big</hi> B. o. E. notes in their tills so long as the
                            10% rate lasted, as the return made to the H. o. C. at the instance of
                            Alderman Salomons amply shows. It was not for the B. o. E. to choose.
                            The B. o. E., during those fatal 3 months of 10%, had outstanding
                            obligations to pay gold on demand to an amount far larger than it had
                            gold to pay, and all these debts might have been demanded in full at
                            short notice. If the B. o. E. had only been a little more obstinate and
                            a little less accommodating, their gold creditors would have demanded
                            prompt payments, and where would the B. o. E. have been then?</p>
                        <p>Fowler says that the Bank Act of 1844 point to a limit to the available
                            supply of money, and thereby is a wholesome check to speculation. Might
                            it not also be said that when the Bank coffers are full, as they are
                            now, and will probably continue, the Act of <choice>
                                <sic>’44’</sic>

                            </choice> stimulates speculation? This law has taught us that, with

                            that the limitation of banknotes relatively to the accidental stock of
                            bullion in the Bank vaults ought to exist by law, and that the law of
                            1844, therefore, a wise and expedient measure. Yet, nevertheless, that
                            some relaxing power is necessary in times of emergency, but that the
                            power of relaxation, meaning an extension of the paper money beyond the
                            limits of the Act of 1844, should rest, as it now rests, with the Gvt.
                            of the day, and not be an integral part of our Currency Law. This means,
                            in fact, that our currency system ought to be regulated by a stringent
                            law, but that, however stringent that law may be in easy times, it
                            should invariably be abrogated in difficult times, and should no longer
                            be law at all. We are told that on three occasions of 1847, 1857, and
                            1866, the Treasury Letter suspending the Bankact of 1844 has sufficed,
                            „as by magic“, to stop all panic, and quickly to restore the normal
                            state of monetary affairs; and that, as this magical suspension is
                            sometimes imperative, a general power should be given to the First Lord
                            of the Treasury and to the Chanc<ex>ellor</ex> of the Exchequer to give
                            the needful authority to the Bank to suspend the law at their
                            discretion. This is, in fact, that the law should be sustained upon the
                            statute book, but that it should never be really put in operation. One
                            of the aims and objects of the law of ’44 was to provide against those <choice>

                            that whenever such emergencies arise there must be no such law at all.
                            The <hi rendition="#u">law was meant to meet all such emergencies</hi>,
                            but it is now argued by this most earnest advocate for the law that <hi rendition="#u">the emergency must be met by suspending the

                            speculative operations so long as it is profitable to pay it, but that
                            the Act of 1844 will and does check such transactions, because in
                            points, in a way that cannot be mistaken, that there is a limit to the
                            available supply of money in the country, and that, however good may be
                            the bills offered, it is not certain that money will be procurable just

                        <p>At the bottom of all transactions there is money. In a rough kind of way
                            the business community may be divided into 2 great sections, the <hi rendition="#u">one dealing with money and the other with
                                merchandise</hi>. The 2 live by one another. The capitalist is
                            always ready to lend, and the merchant willing to borrow, the
                            fundamental basis of dealing being <hi rendition="#u">security</hi>.
                            This is provided by certain <hi rendition="#u">well known contracts
                                formulated upon acknowledged instruments of trade</hi>, such as <hi rendition="#u">bills of exchange, bills of lading, dock
                                warrants</hi>, and the like, <hi rendition="#u">which pass current
                                generally „to order“, and by simple endorsement from hand to
                                hand</hi>. These, when complete, are <hi rendition="#u">recognised
                                as valued transfers of value</hi>. Bills of lading, for convenience,
                            are drawn in sets of 2, 3, 4, and sometimes 5 parts. The number of parts
                            is stated upon the face of each, and the captain certifies that he had
                            signed the number indicated. The important part of the contract between
                            the captain and all other parties to the bill of lading is that he
                            engages to deliver the merchandise in good order, „in witness whereof
                            the master of the said ship hath affirmed to ― ― bills of lading, all of
                            this tenor and date; <hi rendition="#u">the one of which being
                                accomplished, the others to stand void</hi>“.</p>
                        <p>Now the course of dealing is ordinarily after this fashion: A merchant in
                            India buys a parcel of cotton for which he engages to pay. He ships the
                            purchase to London, obtains the bills of lading, and negotiates with an
                            Exchange Bank to draw on the correspondent to whom he consigns the
                            cotton, and assigns the shipping documents as collateral security for
                            the due honor of his draft. In return, the banker pays the amount agreed
                            for, which enables the merchant to meet his engagements. In other words,
                            the bank buys the <pb n="242"/> bills of exchange, reserving power of
                            recourse against all parties as well as against the goods in case of
                            need. The bill is then remitted to the London office, and presented to
                            the merchant’s correspondent, who, being duly advised, accepts the same.
                            In due course the vessel arrives, and the agent sends his cotton to a
                            storekeeper or to a dock warehouse. The storekeeper holds the cotton as
                            bailee for the captain until payment of freight, and, after notice, for
                            the bank who claim a lien for the advances made. The agent next pays the
                            acceptance he has given and takes possession of the documents. He then
                            lodges one bill of lading and a release from the captain’s claim for
                            freight, and obtains from the storekeeper a dock warrant or wharf note,
                            as the case may be. He then possesses a clear title to the goods, and if
                            he should consider the markets unfavourable for immediate operation he
                            can wait, when the certainty of being able to obtain a loan upon the
                            document should need a rise. The storekeeper makes himself responsible
                            for the delivery of the goods on receiving one only of the set of bills
                            of lading, and he does this in virtue of the understanding that „one of
                            which being accomplished the others to stand void“.</p>
                        <p>Nun schöner case of <hi rendition="#u">Meyerstein v<ex>s</ex>.
                                Barber</hi>. J. C. <hi rendition="#u">Azemar et Co</hi>, respectable
                            firm, lately transferred their business to one <hi rendition="#u">Abraham</hi>, formerly in their employ and known in London first as
                            their manager, and afterwards as their successor. A parcel of cotton
                            came to him drawn against in the usual manner. The cotton arrived and
                            was landed under Abraham’s direction, but he appeared to lack the means
                            to obtain the shipping documents. Consequently he could not deal with
                            the merchandise, and had to contrive some scheme to meet the difficulty.
                            He went to the bank and paid the bill by a cheque upon his own banker.
                            He thus released the documents and <hi rendition="#u">immediately
                                negotiated with Meyerstein for an advance upon them</hi>. This was
                            successful, and, Meyerstein’s check being paid into Abraham’s credit,
                            enabled his bankers to liquidate the cheque already given by Abraham. So
                            far no harm done. The scheme was bold, but it had gone through, and all
                            parties stood to come out right. But here the mischief begins. Abraham
                            had deposited <hi rendition="#u">two</hi> bills of lading with
                            Meyerstein, and <hi rendition="#u">one</hi> still remained in his
                            possession. Meyerstein at this time was in the dark as to the arrival of
                            the ship. Meanwhile, Abraham became active. He had been in communication
                            with Mssrs. Barber as to a loan, in the first instance, but the
                            negotiation had dropped, for want of agreement as to the amount. This
                            was no longer of consequence, and the matter was resumed and concluded,
                            eventually, upon Mssrs. Barber’s first proposals. Every precaution was
                            taken; the merchandise was inspected, and, being found free of all
                            liens, the advance was made, the one bill of lading lodged, and the
                            wharfinger issued the customary warrant. The mortgagees, being thus in a
                            possession of the cotton, sold it in their capacity of brokers and
                            repaid themselves out of the proceeds. Part of the cotton was sold by
                            order of Abraham, but somewhere about this part of the business he
                            disappeared or absconded. His flight roused Meyerstein, who instituted
                            inquiry, and finding how the case stood, made his claim on the Barber
                            for the net proceeds of the sale, on the ground that the property in the
                            cotton passed to him with the transfer of the 2 bills of lading.</p>

                        <p>Motion was put into the recent crisis and the working of Act of 1844.

                        <p>This the extraordinary commencement. Dann the resolution moved by <hi rendition="#u">Henry Ashworth</hi>, who stated he <hi rendition="#u">did not</hi> wish to address the meeting, not being in possession
                            of sufficient knowledge to enable him to express any definiheading te
                            idea on the subject. His seconder, Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Bannermann</hi> seconded it, because he was of opinion the <hi rendition="#u">inquiry would be of „no practical use“</hi>, having
                            made up his mind that „the crisis had been caused, not by the Bank Act,
                            but by overtrading“. <hi rendition="#u">Ferguson</hi> supported because
                                <hi rendition="#u">no investigation was necessary</hi>, because the
                            public were able to judge for themselves as to the cause of the panic,
                            the <hi rendition="#u">immediate cause being the failure of Overend et
                                Co</hi>, the proximate causes the speculations of the public in the
                            shares of the lim<ex>ited</ex> liab<ex>ility</ex> Cos, and the action of
                            the financial Cos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Wood</hi> thought the passing of the resolution
                            would not be for the credit of the Manchester Chamber, for it would
                            simply show that they in Manchester were „ignorant of the causes
                                etc“<supplied cert="high">.</supplied> He and Ferguson full of
                            encomiums upon the Bank Act. Dennoch he and Ferg<ex>uson</ex> voted for
                            the resolution. Wood denied that the Act had been suspended more than
                            once. The same Wood gave the following anecdote of <persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000002916">Lord Overstone</persName>: „On the
                            first occasion“, he says, „he asked Lord Overstone whether the
                            suspension of the Act was sought, and Overstone replied that the
                            authorisation was undoubtedly right, for there existed at that period
                                <hi rendition="#u">a state of panic which, if it had not been
                                allayed, would have swept everything away before it, producing a run
                                upon the Bank of England which might have endangered the payment of
                                the notes in gold</hi>.“ And it is said that the Act has secured the
                            convertibility of the note from all danger! The Act works well in
                            raising the price of the capitalists’ money, and in lowering the price
                            of the merchants’ and manufacturers’ goods.</p>

                            were taken as good, have been renewed from time to time, and were bad,
                            and known to be bad, or at least doubtful at the time, and are still
                            unpaid. The <hi rendition="#u">„goodwill“</hi>, as encumbered not only
                            with the legitimate discount business, but with the bad business too,
                            was a <hi rendition="#u">mere fiction</hi>. According to the examination
                            of <hi rendition="#u">John Henry Gurney</hi> they were <hi rendition="#u">loosing</hi> year after year before the transfer. The

                            the old firm – <hi rendition="#u">a myth</hi>. This no mere question of
                            bookkeeping. Of what was that £940,000 composed? Of <hi rendition="#u">undrawn</hi> profits, it is said. But, first, we were led to
                            believe that this £940,000 were profits accumulated during the years
                            following 1861, in which no profits were divided, but now we learn that
                                <hi rendition="#u">no profits were made</hi>, and could, therefore,
                            not <hi rendition="#u">accumulate</hi>. Again, it is said, that these
                            socalled profits <hi rendition="#u">are largely composed of nominal
                                half-yearly additions of enormous rates of interest upon those

                            the pound upon these assets, and they seem to have shown, on paper,
                            that, besides the other items enumerated, they had private estates which

            <p>The sum of £2,320,000 is made up of several items, two of which relate to the Norwich

                            Mr. Gurney admitted, that there would be little or no surplus (!), as
                            the losses would be more disastrous than they had led the new Co. to
                            expect. And at that moment the partners in the old firm and their
                            friends on the new direction were only intent to secure something for
                            themselves. In the transfer of the Norwich Bank, Barclay and Buxton were
                            only to pay the £300,000 for the goodwill on <hi rendition="#u">1</hi><hi rendition="#u"><hi rendition="#sup">st</hi></hi> <hi rendition="#u">March 1870</hi>; ditto the whole or a <hi rendition="#u">larger proportion</hi> of the £760,000 to be
                            postponed until the same period; and the payment of either of them, even
                            at that time, is to be contingent upon the business and the profits and
                            losses of the concern in the meantime. These larger amounts are to be
                            retained by Barclay and Buxton, as a „material guarantee“ against
                            possible losses from any deficiency of assets of these Norwich Banks
                            until March 1, 1870. And the unrealised portion of the other „private
                            estates“ are, we believe, in like manner, pledged to the same parties,
                            and for the same period, as a further guarantee on the part of the
                            vendors, in favour of the purchasers of this Norwich Bank business. The
                            partners in the old firm, after pledging this private estate to the
                            depositors and creditors of the lim<ex>ited</ex> Co., had no right to
                            sell and dispose it to a couple of their private friends and relatives.
                            Nor had Barclay, one of the promoters and directors of the
                                lim<ex>ited</ex> Co., and Buxton, one of its promoters, a right to
                            purchase it for their own benefit. The liquidators, solicitors in

            <p>W<ex>ilkinson</ex>, the scapegoat of public virtue, for having fraudulently applied

                            in chancery. James Freeling Wilkinson, formerly billbroker. 1863 a joint
                            stock Co formed for taking over that business; he became its managing
                            director m<ex>it</ex> minimum salary of £3000 a year. 80,000<hi rendition="#i">l.</hi> bills were abstracted from the billcase, and
                            became utterly lost to the Co.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">Kleman</hi>, a commission agent in the City, had many and large
                            transactions with the Joint Stock Disc<ex>ount</ex> Co. as well as other
                            Cos in the city. Kleman has left the country without leaving any
                            „address“, being heavily indebted to all of them.</p>
            <p>According to Mr. Henry White, the director who had signed these fraudulent cheques,
                            Wilkinson had power to grant loans, and to take securities which in
                            ordinary transactions were <hi rendition="#u">not</hi> submitted to the

                            might be referred to the directors at their weekly meeting, „but that
                            reference would depend upon Mr. Wilkinson making it“. „Each director“,
                            says White, „attended a week in rotation at the bank“, and Wilkinson
                            says that „ordinarily the director who was on the weekly <hi rendition="#u">rota</hi> for signing cheques, when he went to the
                            office, would go up-stairs and sign a lot of cheques, and then go away.“
                            These were all <hi rendition="#u">blank</hi> cheques which Wilkinson
                            could fill up and sign, and deliver to whomsoever he pleased“, and
                                Wilk<ex>inson</ex> „believed that the cheques for the advances that
                            appeared to Kleman’s debt in the loan ledger were signed in that manner.
                            The advances to Kleman increased from 30 000£ to £108,000 between 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> Jan. and <hi rendition="#u">1</hi><hi rendition="#u"><hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> Feb.</hi> 1866, without

                            what is the fact? Russia applied to the money market the other day for a

                            ready to supply Russia with the amount several times told. Chili
                            demanded 2 millions; 17 were offered in the course of a few days. A
                            small colonial railway – the Melbourne and Hobson’s Bay united – wanted
                            50,000£, immediately subscribed. Several other Colonial loans

            <p>„It is admitted“, said Vice-Chancellor <hi rendition="#u">Malins</hi>, „that the old
                            firm of Overend etc was insolvent to the extent of 3 Mill. £, with
                            private property, as a guarantee, upon which there was no lien. No man
                            in his senses, if he had known that, would have taken a single share.“
                            The prospectus was prepared and put forth by the partners in the old
                            firm, who knew the whole truth, and by the friends whom <hi rendition="#u">they</hi> had selected and appointed as <hi rendition="#u">their</hi> colleagues in the direction of the new Co.
                            The future shareholders had no voice in the appointment of these
                            directors, auditors, solicitors, or other officials, nor any opportunity
                            to ascertain the statements of the prospectus. <hi rendition="#u">Malins</hi> stated: „If the true nature of the suspense <choice>

                            concealed, <hi rendition="#u">two deeds became necessary</hi>. „The

                            commercial panic in the remarkable cleverness and facility with which
                            some of the chief delinquents manage to escape, and the fatality with
                            which some one or more of their comparatively innocent colleagues or
                            instruments are made to „stand committed“. Directors misapply or

                            property, and the unlucky manager or somebody else is put in the
                            pillory, and the chief offenders are tarred and feathered by deputy. The
                            scapegoat has carried away their sins, perhaps to bury them in the
                            desert sands of a penal settlement, and „the law is satisfied“ and
                            „justice is appeased“. Wilkinson is convicted of fraudulently
                            misappropriating a cheque, but the director who signed the cheque,

            <p>A clique or cliques of „speculators for the fall“ fastened upon certain Banks etc, in
                            1866, made to fail by the operation of these unscrupulous tricksters.
                            Thus Agra and Masterman’s Bank. A telegram was sent out to India by the
                            operator to a certain clique that it had failed. At that time not the
                            smallest foundation for that rumour. Effect run upon the different
                            branch banks in India (by depositors); London bank unable to meet them,
                            chiefly owing to the great distance; result failure of the London bank.
                                … <hi rendition="#u">dealings for time at Stock Exchange</hi>, i. e.
                            speculators who have no shares allowed to make fictitious sales of
                            shares they do not possess, for delivery at some remote date, upon the
                            prospect of buying them at a lower price, in the interval. Before the
                            said telegram was sent to India, a clique of speculators had sold the <choice>

                            expedients resorted to in order to render those operations profitable.
                            In order that these miscreants should pocket their illgotten gains,
                            widows, orphans, and dependent persons have been ruined or brought to
                            the verge of ruin. If, from any cause, as m<ex>it</ex> d<ex>er</ex> Agra
                            and Masterman’s Bank, there should be a sudden demand for <hi rendition="#u">all</hi> the money lodged by the depositors, while
                            the money lent can only be recovered by instalments as they fall due, no
                            bank could meet such pressure. In 1866 no less than 51,000 persons in
                            England and Wales registered as the <hi rendition="#u">holders of
                                shares</hi> in joint stock banks, including persons in every grade

                        <p>The <hi rendition="#u">periodic recurrence</hi> of speculative manias,
                            and their tendency to promote transactions either positively fraudulent
                            or verging upon fraud, have become familiar historic facts.</p>
            <p>There are now <hi rendition="#u">4 Courts of primary jurisdiction</hi> engaged in
                            winding up joint-stock Cos., their decisions often in striking conflict
                            not only with each other, but with the decisions of the Courts of
                            Appeal. The expenses of these <choice>

                            </choice> enormous, a scandal and disgrace to the law and its
                            administration. „The fees of the Chief Clerks“, said Watkin, „are high,
                            but they are nothing compared with those of the official liquidators“;
                            and he instanced the case of a Bk. Co. which had failed, but at the end
                            5 months had been reopened. The claim of the official liquidator in that
                            case, for 5 months’ work, during which he had employed 12 clerks, whilst
                            he himself had been employed in a host of other concerns as well as the
                            Co. in question, amounted to the modest sum of £38,000. Formerly,
                            official liquidators were paid by a percentage, but latterly, they
                            demand remuneration by the day, and, as Watkin stated, „many of them
                            have been suddenly struck with the great importance of proceeding with
                            due deliberation“. <hi rendition="#u">Mr. Morrison</hi> urged inquiry
                            into the proceeding in voluntary liquidations without the supervision of
                            the Court, „for he had heard of cases of extortion against Cos. which he
                            should like to see brought to the test of truth“. Alderman <hi rendition="#u">Salomons</hi> said: „As to the liquidators, they were
                            a public nuisance. <hi rendition="#u">They caused great delay, and no
                                information could be obtained from them.“</hi></p>

            <p>By law there shall be no more „time“ dealings in bank shares.</p>
            <p>Durch d<ex>en</ex> Stock Exchange pass at least 500 millions of other people’s many
                            annually. The Stock Exchange close body, like a club; about 1000
                            members, governed by a committee of 30, annually elected. The admission
                            of members vested in the Committee etc. The body consists of brokers and
                            jobbers. A stock<hi rendition="#u">jobber</hi> is simply a <hi rendition="#u">stock or share merchant</hi>. No capital would
                            suffice for him to hold a stock to meet the wants of the public at
                            large, and so rapid are the <hi rendition="#u">fluctuations in the
                                prices of securities</hi> that no man of sense, if he had the means,
                            would lay in such a stock. The sharemerchant must therefore be prepared
                            to sell to as well as buy of all comers. This necessity, and the
                            extraordinary pressure of business, have originated a system unknown in
                            any other market. The jobber ascertains the momentary value of a
                            security, and, as it is called, <hi rendition="#u">„makes a price“</hi>.
                            F. i., a holder of Great Western Railway Stock instructs his broker to
                            sell £5000. The broker goes into the market, and asks a jobber to „make
                            him a price in £5000 Great Westerns“. The latter, knowing that the stock
                            has been recently dealt in at 50, „makes“ 49<hi rendition="#sup">3</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> to 50<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> – that is, he undertakes to give
                            the former price for that amount of stock, or to sell it at the latter.
                            If the business is concluded on these terms, the jobber’s only object –
                            unless he happens to have sold the stock previously – is to turn it over
                            at a profit. Of course, if sales preponderate, he may be unable to part
                            with his purchase except at a loss, or may have to find the necessary
                            capital to pay for it at the settling day. Looking at an isolated
                            transaction in this matter, the risk would seem to be very great, but it
                            is in reality less than it appears. So frequent and so enormous are the
                            transactions of the Stock exchange (for all the share operations of the
                            kingdom centre in it) that in most instances a moderate profit is easily
                            realised. Besides, it is not only in London that a jobber deals, and, if
                            unable to close a bargain here, he frequently succeeds in doing so by
                            telegraphing to his correspondents on the various country Exchanges.</p>
            <p>The jobbers take different <hi rendition="#u">„lines“</hi>; some deal in Consols,
                            some in Foreign Stocks, some in Bankshares, other in Indian railway
                            securities, some in colonial bonds, some in the Northern, some in the
                            Southern English lines, others in financial and miscellaneous
                            undertakings. By habit and for convenience, a <hi rendition="#u">certain
                                portion</hi> of the large room (forming the Stock Exchange) is
                            occupied by the dealers in each different class of property, and a
                            member knows at once that in one corner he will be able to deal in
                            Consols and in another in mining shares. As a rule a jobber devotes
                            himself, for the time, to one class of security, changing his market
                            occasionally, as the business in one falls off or in another increases.
                            Certain firms and individuals, however, possessed of unusually large
                            capital, deal through their partners or authorised clerks (clerks whom
                            they invest with special power to deal on their account) in nearly every
                            class of security that is quoted; and there are a few <hi rendition="#u">jobbing millionaires who have correspondents all over the world,
                                and transact business by telegraph in Paris, Vienna, and New
                                York</hi> as well as London. The only possible mode of executing his
                            client’s order expeditiously consists – for the <hi rendition="#u">broker</hi> – in the free market which the jobber creates. The
                            dastardly plots (as against the

            <p>It was <hi rendition="#u">Gordon’s Position</hi> at the <hi rendition="#u">„Oriental

                            expressly at the board of <hi rendition="#u">Overend, Gurney et Co</hi>
                            (lim.) Nay, in the delusive prospectus itself, he stands stereotyped for

                            a further process of fleecing (and allowing Kerls like Oppenheim to win
                            by <hi rendition="#u">a legal fraud</hi>), whilst depreciating any
                            further investigation into the mysteries of the affair. They do their
                            utmost to slur over its iniquity, and to whitewash and rehabilitate the
                            delinquent directors. The <hi rendition="#u"><?oxy_comment_start author="grassmann" timestamp="20190709T104820+0200" comment="Von Marx exzerpiert? Dann Link."?>Economist</hi>,
                            last week (23 March)<?oxy_comment_end?> emphatically explains that it
                            „does not mean to impute to the new directors or the old partners the
                                <hi rendition="#u">slightest formed intention</hi> to deceive the
                            public“. <hi rendition="#u">Unformed</hi> intention perhaps? „The
                            sellers“, he says, „thought they were selling a good thing; the buyers
                            thought they were buying one; and both joined in telling the world what
                            they thought.“ Most outrageous perversion of truth! Neither the sellers
                            (old firm) not the buyers (new firm) thought any such thing; both of
                            them <hi rendition="#u">knew</hi> the contrary, and, therefore, instead
                            of „both joining to tell the world what they thought“, they both joined
                            in executing <hi rendition="#u">a secret deed</hi> to conceal from the
                            world what they knew, and that fact reveals to us what they really
                            thought. <hi rendition="#u">Economist</hi> again repeats that <hi rendition="#u">it</hi> „does not mean to <hi rendition="#u">impute a
                                hint at conscious fraud</hi>, in the minds of either the new
                            directors who bought or the old partners who sold“. <hi rendition="#u">Un</hi>conscious fraud? And, therefore, the evident <hi rendition="#u">consciousness</hi> of the necessity for concealment?
                            Poor perversions, shifty arguments, shallow sophistries. Speech of <hi rendition="#u">Scholefield</hi> (at the meeting of <hi rendition="#u">Engl. and Americ<ex>an</ex> Bank</hi>) asinine. If
                            the new directors were men of ordinary business capacity, they were not
                            deceived, also fraudulent. If they were deceived, how fit to be
                            directors as utterly wanting in ordinary business capacity.</p>

                            condition of the old firm. The <hi rendition="#u">fraud</hi> was
                            complete and entire, on <hi rendition="#u">12 July 1865</hi>, before one
                            single shareholder had joined the Co., and before one single application
                            had been made for shares. Whilst the applications for shares, on the
                            false and fraudulent prospectus, were flowing in, the promoters and
                            directors were occupied in maturing the documents by which the
                            fraudulent compact was to be carried out. Darin acting <hi rendition="#u">d<ex>ie</ex></hi> Messrs <hi rendition="#u">Young,

                            of the new Co. The prospectus, dated 12 July (and issued on that day)
                            stated that „the deed of covenant in relation to the transfer of the
                            business could be inspected at the offices of the solicitors of the
                            Co.“, but that deed was only executed on July 27. Hitherto believed that
                            although the <hi rendition="#u">secret deed</hi> was not offered to
                            inspection at all, the <hi rendition="#u">deed of covenant</hi> was so,
                            whereas it now appears that neither of those deeds executed, also
                            existing, before July 27. Diese deeds, however, bound nobody except the
                            partners the old firm and promoters and directors of the new Co. <hi rendition="#u">On the same 12 July</hi>, notices were sent by the
                            partners in the old firm and the promoters and directors of the new Co.,
                            in their corporate capacity, apprising the creditors of the old firm of
                            the proposed transfer, and asking their assent to it, and to that
                            transfer they assented. By that assent they released the old firm, and
                            accepted as their debtors the new Co. as then incorporated. In the
                            meantime they fished for shares by false prospectus, but no shares were
                            allotted to any of these applicants until <hi rendition="#u">31 July
                                1865</hi>, and the letters of allotment were not issued to them

            <p>9 March meeting of shareholders of <hi rendition="#u">Brighton Railway Co</hi> at
                            London Tavern; decided to appoint a defence committee of <hi rendition="#u">large shareholders</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Sir
                                Charles Jackson</hi> pointed out that <hi rendition="#u">in July
                                1865</hi>, the Directors in their Report said that the <hi rendition="#u">Surrey and Sussexline</hi> was <hi rendition="#u">promoted by an independent</hi> Co, that it was a useful scheme,
                            and that they had accordingly entered into a working arrangement with
                            the prompters. Then, <hi rendition="#u">at the next meeting</hi>, it
                            appeared that the whole capital for this railway was to be provided <hi rendition="#u">by the Brighton Co</hi> alone upon the plea that it
                            was to make a third main line from London to Brighton. The same story
                            appears to apply to the other lines in question, and Sir Ch. Jackson
                            stated that the directors intended not only taking over these
                            3 undertakings, but all their liabilities at par. As to their ever
                            paying a fair rate of interest for the money expended, out of question.
                            „He feared that the directors were interested in those lines, that they
                            were directors’ lines, and that they wanted the Co. to invest their
                            money in them.“</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">London and Northwestern Rail<ex>way</ex> Co</hi> is prosecuting a
                            new line to Sheffield. Dazu meeting for to-day (13 April) berufen.
                            Notices of the meeting (aber without its purpose) reached the
                            shareholders on 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> inst<ex>ant</ex>, and
                            prior to that there had been a canvass for the proxies of the larger
                            shareholders – in some cases by directors themselves. <hi rendition="#u">Most expensive undertaking</hi> which, as it has to compete with
                            the line already in operation, without possibility of paying working
                            expenses. Who is to gain by this new line at the cost of dividends? At
                            all events, not the shareholders. Ebenso <hi rendition="#u">Midland
                                Railway Co.</hi> Large extensions proposed. <hi rendition="#u">Chairman</hi> (at meeting of 15 Febr. Derby) did his best to commit
                            the Co. to this expenditure of millions, and amalgamations; and
                            positively declined to put the amendments. Based this decision of what
                            he regarded as a „show of hands“; when poll demanded, he took no notice
                            of it. Mr. Shepherd states in <hi rendition="#u">Daily News</hi> that
                            within the last 2 years the Midland Co. have spent capital to nearly
                                4<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">2</hi> mill.; at
                            the end of <hi rendition="#u">1862</hi>, the capital applied to all

                                Tavern:</hi> Chairman, <hi rendition="#u">C. H. Knight</hi> said
                            that the Defence Association thought, <hi rendition="#u">good case
                                against the directors</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Mr. Jacomb</hi>
                            reported f<ex>ür</ex> d<ex>ie</ex> Defence Asso<ex>ciation</ex>. <hi rendition="#u">Some 14 months</hi> ago circular of the directors,
                            calling meeting of shareholders for resolution to wind up Co., and
                            dispose of the <hi rendition="#u">works, for the purchase of which</hi>,
                            it was stated, <hi rendition="#u">a proposition was made to the
                                directors</hi>. Dieß meeting held <hi rendition="#u">20 Jan.
                                1866</hi>. Mr. Jacomb showed at this meeting (of 20 Jan.) that it
                            was illegal, because of non-compliance with the articles of association.
                            Solicitor der Co. pooh-poohed him. E. Watkin (<hi rendition="#u">M. P.,
                                late chairman of the Co</hi>, who was not chairman of the <pb n="262"/> meeting, produced a statement of accounts showing that,
                                <hi rendition="#u">subject to a deduction of £60,615</hi>, the whole
                            capital of the Co. was intact. Some shareholders forced out of the
                            directors the admission that the reason for winding up was not the sale
                            stated in the circular, but the financial difficulties of the Co. It was
                            known, in fact, that the negotiations for the sale of the undertaking
                            had fallen through <hi rendition="#u">before meeting was</hi> held.
                            Directors knew that the concern on the verge of bankruptcy. <hi rendition="#u">Watkin</hi> was the principal spokesman of the
                            directors, and produced this account. <hi rendition="#u">Watkin</hi>
                            (M. P.) <hi rendition="#u">had transferred the last of his shares the
                                day before the meeting, so that it now turned out he was not even a
                                shareholder, and had no right to be present</hi>. The resolution for
                            the winding up of the Co. passed. But, 1 or 2 days afterwards the
                            solicitor of the Co. found Jacomb’s view correct, so</p>

                            Chairman said that they were only £10,000 worse than in preceding May,
                            and the before mentioned account showing deficiency of only £60,615
                            again produced. Jacomb said that if the account correct, no reason for
                            winding up Co; if such reason, the account false. Wanted correct balance
                            sheet to be prepared; moved resolution to that effect, but the proxies
                            in the hands of directors were sufficient to neutralise any attempt at
                            investigation. Jacomb objected also to <hi rendition="#u">Child</hi>
                            being appointed as <hi rendition="#u">liquidator</hi>, because that man
                            was the <hi rendition="#u">auditor of the accounts which would be
                                impeached</hi>, and also the <hi rendition="#u">negotiator for Mssrs
                                Pile</hi> in reference for the sale of concern.</p>
                        <p><hi rendition="#u">Meeting on 20 Febr.</hi> Jacomb took the same course,
                            but the power of the directors was too great, and Child’s appointment as
                            liquidator was confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Some time after petition presented to Court of Chancery for winding up
                            the Co. On his application to the Court Child was removed.</p>

                                Liab<ex>ility</ex> Act<?oxy_comment_end?> of 1862. Jacomb instructed
                            to attend before chief clerk on the making of the call by the
                            liquidator. Produced <hi rendition="#u">Watkin’s</hi> account in meeting
                            of <hi rendition="#u">20 Jan.</hi> showing deficiency only of £60,615,
                                u<ex>nd</ex> stated that if accurate, there could be no necessity

                            that word and his initials on the account. Jacomb paid then call.</p>
                        <p><hi rendition="#u">31 Oct. 1866</hi> official liquidator summoned meeting
                            of shareholders, produced true statement. Statt 60,615, Deficit of
                            £259,000; deducting £130,000, reduction in the <hi rendition="#u">value
                                of assets,</hi> as estimated in both accounts, blieb balance of
                            £69,000 unaccounted for by the directors. Ferner liquidator showed that
                            since the resolution to windup the Co. the trading had been carried on
                            at a profit. Hence the further loss of £69,000 must have taken place <hi rendition="#u">before 20 Jan</hi>. The Committee of Defence
                            Association found out that <hi rendition="#u">25,000£ had been paid to
                                the vendors for the property in excess of the amount agreed to</hi>.
                            The <hi rendition="#u">first communication made by the</hi> Directors
                                <hi rendition="#u">report for extraordinary meeting on July 13,
                                1864</hi>. In that report they stated that shareholders would have
                            nearly opportunity of examining the works of the Co. That was followed
                            by invitation to the shareholders to go to Hull to witness the launch of
                            the ship <hi rendition="#u">„Annie“</hi>. A great flourish of trumpets
                            made about that vessel, but what had since transpired? Why the Annie <hi rendition="#u">mortgaged for £10,000</hi> by the vendors at the time
                            when sold to the Co. Directors knew it. Not a word of it came out before
                            meeting of <hi rendition="#u">30 May 1865</hi>. The Annie cost £12,000,
                            and a lot of litigation, and was sold for £8,500. At the time the Co.
                            was started the shareholders were led to believe that they purchased a
                            property, but it turned out that they only bought an equity of
                            redemption, and that there were mortgages to the extent of £88,000,
                            including the 10,000 on the Annie. So the Co. had never a good title to
                            the property, and when they got into difficulties they were unable to
                            take it into the market and raise money on it to relieve them from their
                            embarrassments. Many other instances of mismanagement and
                            misrepresentation. The Co. was born <hi rendition="#u">in concealment
                                and fraud</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">That system was carried on
                                throughout the whole history of the undertaking.</hi> They proposed
                                <hi rendition="#u">proceedings against the directors</hi>, in
                            accordance with the opinion received from counsel. Dagegen spricht <hi rendition="#u">Morris</hi> (shareholder u<ex>nd</ex> solicitor.) <hi rendition="#u">Jacomb</hi> zeigt daß dieser Kerl had been connected
                            with the Co. in 6 different capacities. Viele Statements in Prospectus
                            flagrantly untrue, f. i. that 10,000 shares had been allotted, that a
                            railroad ran into the yard, that contracts for 300 000£ had been entered
                            into at remunerative prices, upon which dividend of 20% was confidently
                            anticipated. No such contracts existed, except on paper. Uebrigens not 3
                            of the directors worth 500£. Some of them completely ruined by their

                                day of settlement of Inland Bills</hi> – will give an indication of
                            the relative activity of our <hi rendition="#u">inland trade</hi>. The
                                4<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> of month may also be occasionally a
                                <pb n="264"/> „heavy day“ for foreign and colonial as well as for
                            inland bills. <hi rendition="#u">Cheques</hi> are often multiplied even
                            for one and the same transaction. F. e., the import and export trade of
                            London is almost entirely done through agents of brokers, and as a
                            consequence, each sale or purchase, when settled, necessitates
                            2 cheques; therefore the operation is represented by double the amount
                            of money in Cheques at the Clearing House. Again, the transactions in
                            discounts and loans, such as are negotiated <hi rendition="#u">through
                                brokers</hi>, always require at least 2 cheques, while a purchase on
                            the Stock Exchange, through a broker, invariably involves the drawing of
                            cheques by 3 separate parties, and sometimes 4, owing to the
                            intervention of the jobber between the buying and the selling brokers.
                            Thus a single transaction may be represented at the Clearing House by a
                            quadruple amount in cheques. F. i. the <hi rendition="#u">buyer of
                                stock</hi> pays a crossed cheque to the his <hi rendition="#u">broker</hi>, the broker a second cheque to the <hi rendition="#u">jobber</hi>, the latter a third cheque to the <hi rendition="#u">selling broker</hi>, who then hands a fourth cheque to the original
                            seller.</p>
            <p>The institution founded on very exclusive principles in <hi rendition="#u">1775</hi>,
                            by a committee of <hi rendition="#u">private bankers</hi>; <hi rendition="#u">joint stock bankers</hi> only admitted 1854; erst in
                                <hi rendition="#u">1864</hi> the B. o. E. jointed the
                            association.</p>
            <p>Until <hi rendition="#u">1854</hi>, when the joint-stock banks jointed the Clearing
                                H<ex>ouse</ex>, the balances or differences were settled in
                            banknotes; and in <hi rendition="#u">1839</hi>, the only year for which
                            statistics are given – the total cheques, and bills passing through the
                            house amounted to £954,401,600, to settle which <hi rendition="#u">banknotes</hi> to the extent of <hi rendition="#u">£66,275,600</hi>, or not quite 7% of the total amount wanted.</p>
            <p>Since 1854 the differences settled by cheques on B. o. E., so that banknotes still
                            further economised, and the bulk of the vast transactions of the

            <p>Infamous swindling. The private Bank of <hi rendition="#u">Israel Barned et Co,</hi>
                            oldestablished, wellknown private bank, since 1809. 1865 <hi rendition="#u">Prospectus</hi> for formation of <hi rendition="#u">Lim<ex>ited</ex> Liab<ex>ility</ex> Co.</hi> with 2 Mill. £.
                            Capital, 40,000 shares, 50£ p. share „for the purchase of this business
                            and to organise it on a broader basis. <hi rendition="#u">160,000£</hi>
                            purchase money, payable by instalments in 2 years, <hi rendition="#u">guarantee by the Barneds of the assets taken over</hi>, a <hi rendition="#u">moderate payment for a lucrative business</hi>“. Dieß
                            alles im Prospect. The assets taken over were utterly rotten, the
                            guarantee utterly worthless. At that moment the <hi rendition="#u">firm
                                Barned</hi> consisted of <hi rendition="#u">Mr. Charles Mozley</hi>
                            and Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Lewin Barned Mozley</hi>. It had then been
                            recently discovered that the Bank <hi rendition="#u">defrauded</hi> by
                            more than 100,000£ by a relative of one of the partners. To repair these
                            losses Lewin Barned Mozley brought a further capital of £20,000 into the
                            Bank, <pb n="266"/> and Charles Mozley £100,000. But this latter sum, as
                            afterwards transpired, borrowed from the Bank o. England on the
                            guarantee of 10 Liverpool merchants, who had taken a mortgage on Charles
                            Mozley’s property for that amount. The business, instead of being, as
                            represented „a large and continually increasing business“, had for some
                            time previously been carried on without profit, if not on annual loss.
                            The profits were variously stated at different times, but the
                            representations always gross misrepresentations. The profits stated 60
                            or 70, or 50, or 40,000£ a year. But when more closely looked into –
                            there were no profits at all for the last 3 years. Closely pressed,
                            Mozley said that from the balance sheet prepared in 1865 <hi rendition="#u">he was not prepared to say that they had lost money,
                                although he could not say that they had made any profit</hi>. At the
                            time of transfer the old firm had lost more than all its capital;
                            carrying on business for several years without any profit; it was under
                                <hi rendition="#u">advances to several Liverpool firms, all of whom
                                have since failed</hi> to £700,000; and their private property
                            deeply mortgaged to provide the means of keeping the bank afloat. Yet
                            these partners presented their profits at sums varying from 40 to
                            70,000£ a year. Lewin Barned Mozley said „he had just looked into the
                            thing, and found that 20 000£ would cover the losses of the last
                            3 years. When Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Bencke</hi>, one of the directors,
                            evinced a disposition also „just to look into the thing“, he was told by
                            Ch. Mozley that „in transactions of that kind it was unusual and highly
                            improper to ask to see private books of accounts“. „The directors of
                            Barned’s Bk. Co.“, says Ch. Mozley, „never made any inquiry into the
                            private property of the partners in the firm of I. Barned et Co. They
                            had confidence in the position they held, and the property which was
                            patent to the town at large.“ So d<ex>ie</ex> new directors duped. The
                            scheme was elaborately planned and cunningly worked out. <hi rendition="#u">Of the 40,000 shares</hi>, 20,000 or one half,
                            representing <hi rendition="#mMM">1 Mill. St., were subscribed for, in
                                pursuance of a previous and secret arrangement, by 2 Cos. – <hi rendition="#u">Contract Corporation</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">Joint Stock Disc<ex>ount</ex> Co</hi> – which had no legal
                                power to subscribe, since then became insolvent, and incapable of
                                performing their engagements. The whole of the debts of this
                                socalled Co, therefore fall upon a limited number of <hi rendition="#u">bona fide</hi> holders of shares, caught by these
                                gross and fraudulent misrepresentations. Hitherto contributions of

                            of those placed upon the list of contributories exhausted or utterly
                            ruined, and still the creditors have only received a fraction of their
                            demand. Liquidators wollen nun die packen, die ihre shares verkauft

            <p>He denounces certain corrupt practices which seem to have prevailed for some time
                            past between the promoters and directors of Joint Stock schemes, and the
                            managers of the Joint Stock Banks and financial associations of this
                            City. He avows: the key to so much bad business having been done in the
                            way of joint-stock-Cos. is <hi rendition="#mMM">to be found in the fact
                                that „it has been made the interest of those to whom was confided
                                the management of other people’s money (i. e. the bankers of the
                                City) to do the bad business“. He says, „he is not making a hasty,
                                vague, and indefinite charge which can only be true in a few
                                exceptional cases“; he vouches for it as a fact within his own
                                personal knowledge and experience that this charge is true <hi rendition="#u">in the vast majority of cases</hi>. „The giving
                                of bribes“, he says, „to the chairman, deputy-chairman,</hi>
                            manager, secretary, confidential legal adviser, or whoever the important
                            man or men may be, in the conduct of the business of the bank from which
                            the money is to be borrowed for a Co. already in existence, or to be

                            practices become, that they seem to be regarded as legitimate by men of

                        <p>The Leeds Banking Co was old and prosperous concern of 30 years standing;

                                repute</hi>. Many of the bills discounted for these persons were

                            discounting them. All these illegitimate and fraudulent transactions
                            were concealed from the directors and kept in secret books, to which
                            they were denied all access. The annual statements and reports were
                            false and fraudulent concoctions, and, at the time the Bank stopped, the
                            directors were engaged in making a further issue of shares amongst their
                            shareholders at a high premium, all of which eagerly taken up on the
                            strength of the false balance-sheets and 25% dividends. Trotz alledem

                            not two of them consecutively who were not now reduced to wretchedness

                            shareholders, of whom there remained only 51; but there were about
                            20 estates of deceased shareholders. 25 died, directly or indirectly, of
                            the losses; 2 or 3 had committed suicide … there were the widows and
                            orphans, aged clergy and lonely females, who lost their all by these
                            frauds, and now objects of wretchedness and misery.“ Dieß beast also
                            pardoned. Chamber of Commerce (Leeds) petitions House of Commons on
                            reasons of this pardon. The <hi rendition="#u">conduct of Gvt. only the
                                more extraordinary</hi> when compared with its conduct in another
                            case. In the prison, from which Greenland released, there was and is
                            still another convict, named <hi rendition="#u">Skaife</hi>. He was a
                            poor half-witted young fellow, clerk to one Marsden, one of the
                            swindlers and forgers to whom Greenland advanced 100<hi rendition="#sup">ds</hi> of 1000<hi rendition="#sup">ds</hi> of £, the moneys of the
                            Bank. When the Bank failed, Marsden escaped to America. Poor Skaife
                            remained and frankly confessed that bills to £20 or 30,000£, found in
                            the Bank, had been signed by him by <hi rendition="#u">Marsden’s
                                direction</hi>. He knew they were forgeries, but said Marsden knew
                            it, and Greenland knew it, and he had done it solely at his master’s
                            instigation, and derived no profit whatever from it. Poor knave was
                            tried for forgery, and convicted, partly <hi rendition="#u">on

                            opportunities offer. <hi rendition="#u">Hence we have the downright
                                frauds and scandalous robberies which are now almost daily exposed
                                in the winding up courts</hi>. … It must be admitted that <hi rendition="#u">the law has almost lost all its influence as a
                                deterrent</hi>, and for the plain reason that it is almost useless
                            for the prevention or detection of these joint-stock and commercial
                            frauds. In many cases where the fraud is undeniable a prosecution, it is
                            said, „would not hold“; in other cases, where a prosecution might be
                            sustained, there being no public prosecutor, no one else is willing to
                            undertake the invidious task; and, even where a prosecution has been
                            instituted and succeeded, ends of justice may subsequently be defeated
                            by the capricious intervention <pb n="269"/> of an incompetent
                                Secret<ex>ary</ex> of State, as in the present case.</p>
                        <p><hi rendition="#u">Lord Frederick Cavendish</hi>, one of the M. P.
                                f<ex>ür</ex> North-West Riding of Yorkshire, sprach über Greenland
                            case <hi rendition="#u">in H. o. C.</hi> „Greenland had been prosecuted
                            for perjury in reference to the banknotes issues“ and „when the <hi rendition="#u">Board of Inland Revenue</hi> were applied to“ durch
                            Leeds Ch<ex>amber</ex> of Comm<ex>erce</ex>, „and urged to prosecute,
                                <hi rendition="#u">they declined</hi>, but stated that they would
                            afford assistance to any persons who chose to undertake the
                            prosecution“, viz. <hi rendition="#u">at their won expense</hi>. „The
                            judge at the trial had expressed its surprise that the prosecution of
                            such a case had fallen upon private persons.“ Lord F. Cavendish
                            continued: „When Greenland was taken to prison, he was placed in the
                            hospital, where he remained for 3 months, but, in consequence of the <hi rendition="#u">report to the visiting justices</hi>, he was removed
                            to one of the cells. The visiting justices were therefore greatly
                            astonished when they afterwards received intelligence that Greenland had
                            obtained a free pardon.“ That pardon was obtained by Greenland’s
                            solicitor, upon the strength of a memorial which he addressed to the
                            Home Secretary and came up to London to present in person. Lord
                            Cavendish said: „Doubts would arise whether, in the administration of
                            justice, distinctions were not made between different classes. It was
                            difficult to believe that a <hi rendition="#u">poor man who had no
                                solicitor</hi> would have received a remission of the greater part
                            of his sentence because he was in a state of health which, in the <hi rendition="#u">opinion of the</hi> (prison) surgeon, would <hi rendition="#u">not justify his removal to the hospital of the
                                prisony</hi>. <hi rendition="#u">Hardy</hi> said im trial „the Jury
                            had recommended Greenland to mercy on account of his age etc.“ Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Hardy</hi>, „with the report of the trial at the
                            Central Criminal Court before him“, knew perfectly well that the
                            recommendation of the jury was to the <hi rendition="#u">mercy of the
                                judge</hi>, and that the judge had given effect to it by giving the
                            dog only 15 months imprisonment instead of 15 years penal servitude. <hi rendition="#u">W. Morrison</hi> drew the attention of the House „to
                            the fact that the perjury of which this old man had been convicted had
                            extended for a period of <hi rendition="#u">nearly 20 years</hi>“. „If
                            Greenland had had not an able solicitor and wealthy and influential
                            friends, he would have been permitted to serve out the remainder of his
                            short sentence.“ Other criminals, who have committed only one single act
                            of perjury, are sentenced to <hi rendition="#u">penal servitude</hi>,
                            and <hi rendition="#u">unless they happen to have made money enough by
                                their frauds to retain a clever attorney</hi>, are compelled to
                            undergo their allotted sentence. … The <hi rendition="#u">plea of
                                humanity and mercy</hi> becomes <hi rendition="#u">mere cant</hi> in
                            solchem Fall. It is an <hi rendition="#u">hypocritical abuse</hi> to
                            apply them to <hi rendition="#u">the wealthier of the criminal classes
                                alone</hi>, whilst in effect denying them to the poorer. <hi rendition="#u">During the past week (ending August 3, 1867)</hi> an
                            inquest was held on the body of a <hi rendition="#u">pauper in one of
                                our metropolitan workhouses</hi> who, <hi rendition="#u">at the age
                                of 80</hi>, had been compelled to <hi rendition="#u">turn out</hi>
                            and <hi rendition="#u">work at drawing a dust-cart in a drenching
                                rain</hi>. The poor wretch was seized with cold shivers and died,
                            and before he died he was wicked and ungrateful enough to declare that
                            „that cart and that rain had killed him“, and that the brutal officer
                            who had compelled him to the task was guilty of his death. That man’s
                            only crimes were poverty and old age – great crimes no doubt in a human
                            and Christian county – but still the old man could not very well help
                            either. If that old man had lived a riotous and extravagant life,
                            committing frauds et perjuries during a period of 20 years, to the utter
                            ruin or impoverishment of a 1000 innocent victims, and had thus made
                            himself a well-to-do criminal instead of a beggarly pauper, humanity
                            would have taken much more interest in him and „much better care of
                                him.<supplied cert="high">“</supplied></p>

            <p>Consecrates fraud. The argument that shareholders under such circumstances must be
                held liable is tantamount to saying that a man must pay a cheque stolen from him
                because a creditor of the thief should plead that he parted with property of the
                strength of the drawer’s name, and that therefore the drawer had no right to stop

                            punish the actors in them. It, therefore, denies them the privilege of

                            tend to criminate themselves, and, at the same time, tempts them to a
                            full confession by the offer of a plenary pardon. This law is a standing
                            incitation to even the most culpable of mercantile delinquents to come
                            and confess and be absolved without the infliction of any penalties.

            <p>Kitto was 11 years a miner and manager of mines in Victorian, 7 years a Gvt mining
                            surveyor. His conviction: The occupation of the mere digger is drawing
                            to an end, while that of the practised miner is being rapidly developed
                            under large profits already achieved. Goldmining in Australia no longer

                            One <hi rendition="#u">third of the gold yielded by Victoria during 1866
                                was the result of quartz-crushing</hi>. Nach Official <hi rendition="#u">„Mineral Statistics of Victoria for 1866“</hi> quartz
                            crushed (1866) 861,468 tons, and the <hi rendition="#u">average yield of
                                gold per ton: 10 dwt. 16.2 gr</hi>. The price paid for treating the
                            quartz v<ex>on</ex> 4s. to £1. 10s. per ton. (Dieß jedoch nur

                            much more than the cost of crushing, nach <hi rendition="#u">T. Eyre</hi>, manager of the Catharine Reef Co.: „For the 6 months

                                12 months</hi>.“ This statement coincides with that given by the

                            in mining arithmetic is equivalent to <hi rendition="#u">4 shillings</hi>, so that 3<hi rendition="#sup">1</hi>/<hi rendition="#sub">4</hi> dwts. is the average <hi rendition="#mMM">cost of treating the quartz. <hi rendition="#u">Kitto</hi> gives an
                                estimate based on an outlay of £25,000 for a mining and
                                quartz-crushing establishment, and that <hi rendition="#u">only
                                    7 dwts. or 28 shilling per ton on average are obtained</hi>.
                                Allowing £10,900 for contingencies, such as loss of time through
                                accidents to machinery etc, dennoch clear profit of <hi rendition="#u">£12,500</hi> or <hi rendition="#u">50%</hi> would
                                accrue to the shareholders. As Kitto says: „In a few years <hi rendition="#u">individual mining</hi>, as it is called, will be
                                no more known; the <hi rendition="#u">quartz mines</hi> and deep <hi rendition="#u">leads</hi> will become <hi rendition="#u">the
                                    property of the capitalist</hi>, and will be worked with science
                                and skill; … and <hi rendition="#u">once more the social system will
                                    be properly regulated</hi>.“ Im Anfang glaubte man, daß

                            localities worth the attention of the gold-seeker; and that, once
                            ransacked and made to yield up their spoil, nothing would be left on
                            which to rear a permanent industry. A <hi rendition="#u">Commission</hi>
                            of the <hi rendition="#u">Victorian Gvt.</hi>, 1856, to report on the
                            state of the mines, declared that mining for gold to great depths in
                            quartz reefs would be unprofitable; useless, they said, to go <hi rendition="#u">below 10 miner’s fathoms or 60 feet</hi>. Dieß theory
                            false, as proved in California and Australia. A <hi rendition="#u">Californian mine</hi> is now being worked at <hi rendition="#u">a
                                depth of 1,250 feet</hi> from the surface, and is <hi rendition="#u">producing better ore than ever</hi>. Kitto gives a long list of

                            2 × the area in present occupation of mines is quite as valuable for

            <p>Collapse (Commercial) at Bombay. Scarcely anticipated the degree of prostration in
                            this „city of millionaires“.</p>
            <p>Indian cotton Exports etc in Folge d<ex>es</ex> American Civil War. Bombay was the
                            centre and outlet of the cotton growing districts of <hi rendition="#u">Western India</hi>, the chief port from which England drew its
                            supply. Darauf based huge speculation. Raw cotton, which in Interior of
                                <hi rendition="#u">Bombay presidency</hi> had been worth 80 rupees
                            per candy before the American war, rose to 600 rupees afterwards. For a
                            time gains to producers and middlemen – i. e. merchants and brokers of
                            Bombay – prodigious. This <hi rendition="#u">sudden accession of wealth
                                produced insatiable desire for more;</hi> Result wie gewöhnlich <hi rendition="#u">Time Bargains</hi>. Finance Cos., oder, wie sie in

                            Some for useful projects; but the common ruin enveloped <hi rendition="#u">legitimate enterprise m<ex>it</ex> bubble Cos.</hi>
                            Bombay built upon island too small for its population and commerce.
                            Harbour magnificent, by position and other natural advantages, greatest
                            port for Ocean communication between India and Europe. Large tract of
                            land around the city covered only by a few feet of water, leicht to
                            reclaim, Joint Stock Co, während d<ex>es</ex> Schwindels, formed to this
                            purpose. Large portion of the work has been done; but, up tot he present
                            time, obgleich millions sunk upon these works, not a shilling of the
                            outlay has yet been rendered available. Not a single house or warehouse
                            can be erected upon the halffinished work, except that small portion
                            whereon stands the terminus of the <hi rendition="#u">Great Indian
                                Peninsula Railway</hi>. The Gvt. of India, by its contract with that
                            Co., had to provide a terminus 50 acres in extent for goods traffick.
                            Bombay Island alone could not supply the land wanted, hence <hi rendition="#u">„Elphinstone Co“</hi> formed to effect the object in
                            view. Performed substantial work, for which it paid hard cash. It
                            required the whole site required for the terminus, and also a large area
                            of land on the harbour shore. In Bombay a perfect glut of shares, some
                            quite valueless on demerits, the aggregate amount far beyond the
                            capacity of the place for legitimate business. Hence <hi rendition="#u">Elphinstone Co. Shares</hi> find no buyers od<ex>er</ex> at ruinous
                            prices for the holders. No bank in India will advance a farthing on
                            them. No capitalists want them because, m<ex>it</ex> 400 rupees paid on
                            them, there is a further liability of 600 rupees upon each share.
                            Several Cos were (während d<ex>em</ex> Schwindel) formed for reclamation
                            of land around the island of Bombay, but majority have failed, nur 2

            <p>M. <hi rendition="#u">Chevalier</hi> predicted that „the transition (from fall of
                            gold value) would be an interval painful to pass, and would be marked by
                            innumerable shocks and sufferings“. The value of all properties, he said
                            „would be subjected to a painful uncertainty and injurious fluctuations.
                            It would be still worse for persons whose incomes consisted of a sum of
                            money fixed in advance. They would live in a perpetual state of trouble,
                            anxiety, and uneasiness“. Er unterstellt stets that gold would fall to
                            half of its recognised value. The fixed income man „would be flung
                            headlong, without rule or measure, down to a lower station, and without
                            the chance of preparation, as it was of the very essence of changes of
                            this kind, subject to so many <hi rendition="#u">opposing
                                influences</hi>, to pursue an irregular and disorderly course“. His
                            assumption u<ex>nd</ex> reasoning equally absurd. Change nothwendig slow
                                u<ex>nd</ex> very gradual. D<ex>ie</ex> opposing influences could
                            not but produce compensating circumstances.</p>
            <p>The general rise in prices since 1853 is indisputable and now almost universal, and
                            the inference of a corresponding fall of gold is inevitable. If
                            increased supplies of gold accompanied by a corresponding increase in
                            the demand for gold, there would have been no disparity between demand
                            et supply. There would have been no relative increase, no excess of
                            supply over demand. The excess from California and Australia was
                            absorbed in new fields by the enlarged commerce of England, America, and
                            other countries. Then American Civil War. The war expenditure absorbed
                            the greenbacks. Sobald England gold received form Austr<ex>alia</ex> et

                            the majority of the shareholders cannot or will not pay calls, and that
                            minority will have to pay all. Trotzdem <hi rendition="#u">creditors</hi> have only been paid <hi rendition="#u">2sh. in

                            £376,947 would represent now nearly the same sum. So bulk of £50
                            p. share will be called up by the liquidators, so that shareholders will
                            lose every farthing of their money, and even the creditors not fully
                            paid. No farthing left for the shareholders.</p>
            <p>King asserts that the <hi rendition="#u">register</hi> (of shareholders is rotten,

                            Rate – „entail distress“, says Gassiot, on the merchant, trader and
                            manufacturer, but more particularly on <hi rendition="#u">those
                                employers of labour who require large sums of money to pay weekly
                                wages</hi>, and whose only safety from ruin, when money is raised to
                            an exorbitant rate, too often rests on <hi rendition="#u">discharging
                                large masses of the hardworking industrious mechanics</hi> employed
                            in their extensive works.“ In proof and illustration of this, he refers
                            to the record of the Mansion-house Committee, the closing of the
                            workshops on Bank of Thames, and the <hi rendition="#u">multitudes

            <p><hi rendition="#u">Suspensions of the Bank Act</hi>, says Gassiot, „have ever

                            compel them in such times to obtain money at the rate of 20 and 30%
                            p. a.“ Mentions that <hi rendition="#u">B. o. E.</hi> paid in <hi rendition="#u">October 1866</hi> 13% p. a. on Capital of

            <p>The object of the Bank Directors was to avail themselves of the exorbitant rate 10%,

                                of their fixed issues</hi> for the benefit of commerce. In case they
                            exceeded the limits, the profits, nach Gladstone’s letter, of overissue
                            went to Gvt; if not exceeded, the whole profit of the 10% rate went into
                            their pockets. <hi rendition="#u"><?oxy_comment_start author="grassmann" timestamp="20190710T165056+0200" comment="NR"?>J. B. Smith<?oxy_comment_end?></hi>
                            stated in the H. o. C.: „They (the <hi rendition="#u">Bank of
                                England</hi>) sent to their customers and borrowed banknotes from
                            them, in order to prevent the infringement of the Act, and the Act was
                            therefore not infringed.“ <hi rendition="#u">Frazer’s Magazine</hi>
                            <hi rendition="#u">(August 1866)</hi> says: „The letter of the law was
                            only saved by the London bankers responding to an appeal from the
                            Bank o. E. Court <hi rendition="#u">to pay every night</hi> to the
                            banking department all the notes which, under ordinary circumstances,
                            would have remained in the tills of the bankers themselves.“ So the
                            directors secured to their proprietors all the advantage of the high
                            rate. With all these means, the <hi rendition="#u">credit of the Bank
                                Act</hi> could not be saved. „On the <hi rendition="#u">30</hi><hi rendition="#u"><hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> May</hi>“, says Gassiot,
                            „its <hi rendition="#u">Reserve was</hi> reduced to £415,865, and at
                            that time the Bank was entirely dependent upon <hi rendition="#u">the
                                nightly assistance of the London bankers</hi>, and on the
                            forbearance of its depositors, to avoid the use of the Gvt. letter.“ The
                            principle of the Act as much violated by such reduction of Reserve, as
                            if the limits of issue exceeded by millions.</p>
            <p>The <hi rendition="#u">Times in leading Article of 13 Nov. 1857</hi>, on the panic of
                            that year, said: „Yesterday the commercial public received the news that
                            the Bank Charter Act had been suspended. The commercial interests of the
                            country should not be submitted to a system by which a law is obeyed so
                            long as obedience is easy, and temporarily swept away as often as
                            pressure or panic intervenes. The houses which in 1847 and 1857 have
                            stopped payment <hi rendition="#u">before</hi> the relaxation of the
                            law, may well complain that, whilst they have been crushed by the

                            standing than themselves have been saved by the suspension of the

                            upon certain terms, and that agreement is still subsisting, and the
                            debtor claims to have it carried out.“ In addition to such advances upon
                            such securities as these, <hi rendition="#u">the Bank have for some time

                            shares to the number of 264, which the Bank have acquired by purchase or
                            otherwise since 1858. These dealings in their own shares rendered legal
                            by a special clause in the Co’s Deed. But most scandalous transactions

                            would sustain heavy loss. Said ferner: „The agreements before alluded to
                            were executed early in 1860; <hi rendition="#u">did not come before the

                            money? „He had the full particulars of the losses, and the names of
                            these through whom they had been sustained, but <hi rendition="#u">it
                                could do no good to publish them</hi>.“ „They could not blow up
                            these debtors without doing an injury to themselves.“ He recommended,
                            therefore, „the avoidance of all ill feeling and recrimination … he
                            recommended a <hi rendition="#u">voluntary</hi> in preference to a <hi rendition="#u">compulsory winding up</hi>, because by the former <hi rendition="#u">they would avoid publicity</hi> being given to their

                            Banner’s arguments have been used, and with fatal effect, for many years
                            past by many boards of <hi rendition="#u">railway directors</hi>, and,
                            under cover of it, (thus to get more out of the debtors) the duped and
                            quiescent shareholders and debenture holders have been defrauded of
                            millions invested in those undertakings. The same sort of thing has been

                            both. But, except as to Assets, assimilation imperfectly performed in
                            both cases. Hence the appearance of the trio in the winding up court.
                                <hi rendition="#u">Cont<ex>inental</ex> Bank
                                Corp<ex>oration</ex></hi> founded <hi rendition="#u">Jan. 1863</hi>,
                            5000 shares of £100 each, subsequently increased to 10,000 shares of
                            like amount, thus making a capital of 1 M<ex>ill</ex>. £, wholly
                            subscribed. On the first 5000 shares £25 p. share called up, on the
                            second 5000 shares £15 p. share. Bank had thus paid up capital of <hi rendition="#u">£200,000</hi>. Within 2 years, viz. by the <hi rendition="#u">early part of 1865</hi>, this Bank <hi rendition="#u">had lost the whole of its capital, and was considerably in debt
                                besides</hi>; yet, at that moment, the <hi rendition="#u">directors</hi> in their Report to shareholders, with a most
                            pretentious affectation of candour, regretted that they had sustained
                            considerable losses, „deemed it their duty to make the shareholders
                            acquired <hi rendition="#u">with the precise condition of their affairs,
                                and to exhibit the whole losses incurred</hi>“, and then confessed
                            that <hi rendition="#u">„the total loss amounted to £19,500“</hi>. It
                            amounted <hi rendition="#u">über</hi> £200,000. In order to meet these
                            difficulties, the <hi rendition="#u">Lond<ex>on</ex> u<ex>nd</ex>
                                    Mediterr<ex>anean</ex></hi> Bank was formed <hi rendition="#u">April, 1865</hi>, m<ex>it</ex> capital of 2 mill., in <hi rendition="#u">100,000</hi> shares of £20 each, of which it was
                            stated in prospectus that „80,000 shares had been already subscribed“.
                            Object of the Co. to take over the business of <hi rendition="#u">Contin<ex>ental</ex>
                            </hi>Bk., converting its 100£ shares into £20 ones; and also to take
                            over the banking business of Messrs. <hi rendition="#u">Landau et
                                Co.</hi>, of <hi rendition="#u">Alexandria</hi>, „and to facilitate
                            commercial and financial transactions between this Country, Continent,
                            and Egypt“. But statement that <hi rendition="#u">80,000</hi> shares
                            subscribed, utterly false. The bona fide applications for the new shares
                            only <hi rendition="#u">1800 shares</hi> in number. Yet the promoters
                            obtained a nominal <hi rendition="#u">quotation of the shares a
                                considerable premium</hi>. To obtain a settlement on the Stock
                            Exchange, <hi rendition="#u">„the fictitious issue of a large number of
                                shares“</hi> was resorted to, in order to make up the requisite
                            proportion of their capital, and, as a necessary adjunct to this, „the
                            parties engaged in this scheme did not hesitate to manufacture a book,
                                <hi rendition="#u">purporting to be a banker’s pass book</hi>, in
                            order to carry out the pretence of payments of deposits on the
                            fictitious subscription of shares.“ The report further shows that „a
                            large sum, nearly approaching £40,000, was lost out of the assets of the
                                <hi rendition="#u">Contin<ex>ental</ex> Bank
                                Corp<ex>oration</ex></hi> in <hi rendition="#u">the purchase of its
                                own shares</hi>. Trotzdem no settlement, scheme broke down. Landau
                            et Co. discovered that „there was no real substance in the new Bank“,
                            and, although they had received no less than £60,000 to carry on the
                            business, they ultimately obtained an abrogation of the agreement. That
                            transaction m<ex>it</ex> Messrs. Landau resulted in direct loss of
                            £22,000 to the shareholders, beyond loss of £40,000 on the purchase on
                            the shares in the Contin<ex>ental</ex> Bank, making a total loss of over
                            £60,000 on the Landau purchase. But the transfer to the <hi rendition="#u">Lond<ex>on</ex> u<ex>nd</ex>

                            when it ought to have been handed over. But, inasmuch as the <hi rendition="#u">liquidators</hi> of the <hi rendition="#u">Cont<ex>inental</ex> Bk.</hi> were also the <hi rendition="#u">liquidators of the Medit<ex>erranean</ex> Bk.</hi>, and the

                            small addition to their liab<ex>ilities</ex> was of no account. <hi rendition="#u">Bank N. 2</hi> having thus failed the purpose of

                            the business of the <hi rendition="#u">Medit<ex>erranean</ex> Bank</hi>

                            to the mercantile community.“ Liquidation had gone on for 12 months,
                            creditors had only yet received <hi rendition="#u">5s. in £</hi>. Sir

                            ought to be removed from the liquidation. Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Kintrea</hi> (also a shareholder) said: In the last balance sheet
                            said that the concern was paying 10%, and was in a position to pay other
                            10%, „but that document“, inducing many to buy shares, „one of the
                            grossest illusions perpetrated. He, for one, desired to bring the
                            directors to a court of justice, to compel them to repay him“. Charges
                            against the directors, bes<ex>onders</ex> the chairman u<ex>nd</ex>
                            <hi rendition="#u">Sir R. Carden</hi> of the gravest character. Mr. <hi rendition="#u">Finley</hi> said that at the very lest meeting of the

                                shares</hi>. The chairman of the meeting said that „he had called
                            upon Sir R. Carden on <hi rendition="#u">the day before the day on which
                                the Bk. stopped payment</hi>, and that Carden had then assured him,
                            on the honour of a gent<ex>leman</ex>, that the Bank was perfectly
                            sound“.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hoskins, another shareholder said that in <hi rendition="#u">1866 Charles Bye
                                Colchester</hi>, the Chairm<ex>an</ex> of the Bank, had stated that
                            „the Bk. was in such a prosperous condition that he would recommend
                            anyone who, <hi rendition="#u">as a trustee, had funds to invest</hi>,
                            to invest them in this Bank“. On his question to Colchester what their
                            liabilities were on <hi rendition="#u">For<ex>eign</ex> Securities</hi>,
                            he stated them to be between £70 and 80,000, whereas it now appeared
                            that they were at the time £280,000.</p>
            <p><hi rendition="#u">At the meeting d<ex>er</ex> shareholders</hi> (19 Nov.) chairman
                                <hi rendition="#u">Potter</hi> said: <hi rendition="#u">Carden</hi>
                            had told them they would have v<ex>on</ex> £7 to 10£ per share of their
                            capital returned to them. Stattdessen they were called upon for
                            instalment of £2. 10s. to meet their liabilities, other calls would
                            follow in quick succession. <hi rendition="#u">Oliver</hi> says: all the

                                Bank</hi>, who were so at the time of the amalgamation, had all
                            withdrawn, except <hi rendition="#u">Thompson</hi>. They had also, at
                            different periods, <hi rendition="#u">got rid of their shares</hi>. The

                            but incurred losses etc. At <hi rendition="#u">last meeting, March
                                1866</hi>, Sir <hi rendition="#u">W. Carden</hi> presided, made

                            13-14,000 £. A <hi rendition="#u">retired colonel</hi> bought 100 shares
                            on Carden’s Representations. <hi rendition="#u">Harding u<ex>nd</ex>
                                Morgan</hi>, their auditors, at same meeting told, that they were

                            registered. It now appeared that another Co. puts in a claim to the land
                            assigned to the Bk. as a security for the advance in question,

                            suspension of the European Bank had led to their embarrassments. … Since
                            it became known that a call of £2. 10s. was about to be made, a great
                            many shares had been transferred to men of straw. There were 2 or 3
                            clerks in the office whose names now on the register for a large number
                            of shares. One held 200, another 250 (a nephew to Colchester who never
                            held a share while the Bank was a going concern, diese 250 shares). <hi rendition="#u">Colchester selbst</hi> (d<ex>er</ex>

                            (shareholder) says: „Colchester the high priest of the sacrifice of the

                            after lose. There was so much rottenness u<ex>nd</ex> foul play going on
                            in the management of the concern that it was questionable if a criminal

                            parties. As <hi rendition="#u">City Editor</hi> in <hi rendition="#u">Times</hi> remarks: „every writer on the subject correctly points
                                <hi rendition="#u">to the trade which a certain set of accountants

                            liquidators are encouraged to place themselves, and their clients, and
                            the estate, in the hands of the attornies. The attornies very naturally
                            relieve themselves from all responsibility by „taking the opinion of
                            counsel“, and counsel, quite as naturally, are continually advising
                            bills and petitions and motions and applications to the Court which, if
                            not wholly unnecessary, might be avoided. In this way liquidators are
                            constantly occupied in embroiling their clients in litigious
                            proceedings, and involving the estate in the cost of it. Year after year
                            the various Chambers of Commerce have been clamouring for an Act to <hi rendition="#u">confer upon the creditors and their official nominee

                            had been so well conducted by Mrs. Sizeland“. <hi rendition="#u">Capital</hi> £25,000 in 2,500 shares of £10 each; defendant named
                            in the prospectus as one of the directors. Hawes was to receive £2,500

                            at 30 shares. It was not „a bubble“. There was a good and bona fide
                            business, but not successful; on <hi rendition="#u">24 Febr. 1866</hi> a
                            winding up order was made. Present proceedings originated in Bill filed
                            by Rev. Mr. Henderson, against Sir. E. Lacon et the other directors, to
                            have his name removed from the list of contributories, and his allotment
                            and deposit money repaid to him, on ground of misrepresentation in
                            prospect, and through the subsequent stages of the Co’s career. Case
                            came before Vice Chanc<ex>ellor</ex> Sir W. Page Wood. Wood decided <hi rendition="#u">for</hi> the plaintiff against Lacon et other
                            directors.</p>
            <p>The prospectus represented that the directors had „concluded an agreement“ for the
                            purchase of the properties; that the Co. would enter into full
                            possession of the hotel „early in the ensuing spring“; that the house,
                            „prior to the ensuing season“, would be remodeled and enlarged; and that
                            „the directors and their friends <hi rendition="#u">had subscribed a
                                large portion of the capital</hi>“, and offered the <hi rendition="#u">remaining shares to the publi</hi>c.“ Henderson
                            darauf applied for 50 shares, <hi rendition="#u">on 15 March 1865</hi>
                            <pb n="284"/> allotted to him. But <hi rendition="#u">May 1865</hi>,
                            from circumstances which came to his knowledge, Henderson began to doubt
                            the bona fides and prospectus of the Co.; and having found upon inquiry
                            that only <hi rendition="#u">762 shares had been allotted</hi> and <hi rendition="#u">only about 430</hi> more <hi rendition="#u">agreed to
                                be taken</hi>; that <hi rendition="#u">the directors were not duly
                                qualified</hi>, and that such shares as had been taken <hi rendition="#u">had not been subscribed for by the directors and
                                their friends</hi>, he wrote, <hi rendition="#u">July 1865</hi>, for
                            return of his allotment u<ex>nd</ex> deposit money, which was refused.

                            </choice> this bill. It appeared by the evidence that „the agreement for
                            purchase“, so far from having been <hi rendition="#u">„concluded“</hi>
                            in February, was not concluded until August, and that the business of
                            the Co in the hotel did not commence until July. As to the other
                            statements, <hi rendition="#u">Wood</hi>, the Vice Chancellor, said it
                            was clear that there had been a misrepresentation in the prospectus as
                            to the „directors and their friends having subscribed a large portion of
                            the capital“. In fact, at the time when the plaintiff made his
                            application <hi rendition="#u">no one of the directors had subscribed
                                for shares in any sense of the word</hi>, and <hi rendition="#u">the
                                friends of the directors</hi>, i. e. their business connections,
                            consisted of no more than <hi rendition="#u">one firm at Norwich</hi>.
                            Wood said „it <hi rendition="#u">surprised him</hi> that <hi rendition="#u">gentlemen of position</hi> should consent to
                            authorise what in their private affairs they never would have consented
                            to permit – namely, that their names should be used in this way to carry
                            out a speculation of this kind … it was their plain duty when, on
                            15 March, they heard of the plaintiff’s application, to have returned to
                            him his proposal, which they must have known had been made upon
                            misrepresentation.“</p>

            <p>There is no longer any doubt that the <hi rendition="#u">principle of
                                combination</hi> applied to the development of industrial wealth is
                            far <hi rendition="#u">more powerful in its influence upon the progress
                                of nations than that of mere individual enterprise</hi>. But, when
                            exercised without any legitimate restraint, may be used for the worst of
                            purposes. Under lim<ex>ited</ex> liab<ex>ility</ex> the nation has,
                            during the last few years, been intoxicated with visions of rapidly
                            acquired wealth. The eagerness, with which a number of speculative
                            persons have sought to enrich themselves at the cost of others has
                            carried with it the seeds of self-destruction, which only required time
                            to develop their fatal results.</p><milestone unit="section" rendition="#hr"/><lb/>
