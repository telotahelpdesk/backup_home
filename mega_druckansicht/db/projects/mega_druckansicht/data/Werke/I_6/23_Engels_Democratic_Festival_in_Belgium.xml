                <p><hi rendition="#k">Brussels.</hi> — A democratic supper was held on Monday,
                    26th Sept., at the Estaminet Liegeois. There were present Belgians, Frenchmen,
                    Swiss, Poles, Italians, and even a Russian. M. Gottrand, ancient member of the
                    Constituant Congress of Belgium (in 1831) took the chair, General Mellinet
                    having declined. He was assisted by Messrs Imbert, former editor of the <hi rendition="#i">Peuple Souverain</hi>, of Marseilles (French), and Engels
                    (German), vice-presidents. The principal toasts drank were: — “The Martyrs
                    of Liberty”, by M. Imbert. “The Memory of the French Jacobin Revolution of 1792
                    and 1793”, by M. Engels. “The English Democracy — may they send us a
                    representative to our next fraternal meeting”, by M. Spilthoorn, of Ghent.
                    “Death to the Jesuits of all kinds”, by M. Marty, Swiss. “The union of all
                    people”, by M. Wallan, president of the German Working Men’s Society. M.
                    Bartels, of Brussels, proposed to make the coming anniversary of the Polish
                    Revolution, a fraternal demonstration, in which democrats of all nations should
                    partake. Another motion was proposed — that a Democratic Society,
                    representing as much as possible all nations, should be formed. Both motions
                    were agreed to.</p>
