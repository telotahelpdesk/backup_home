          which, as much as I remember, will not have failed to charm you, for the amount of
          nonsense developed in it. Sense is so rare in our age, and one does always well, to do
          like the majority does.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately I have much lazy time now, and I earnestly regret,
          that none of my London friends come to pay me a visit. I could have been on the spree with
          him all day and night. Since <seg type="comment"><orig>this nice war</orig><note xml:id="b2e1cac5-d099-4a8b-9079-aefd757a0a53">Der Deutsche Krieg (1866).</note></seg>
          broke out, things broke down altogether in France and especially in Paris. We for our
          part, we have absolutely nothing to do, and intend to shut shop completely this week. As
          for being paid, for work that has been done, before this crisis, it is utterly impossible.
          We were often, theese last days, in a most awkward position, as we work only for one
          customer almost, and the fellow not giving us a farthing, although he oughs us some
          16 000 Francs now. We had bills to meet of a large amount, and no probability of
          doing so. One time we were even much afraid, we should never get paid, as the man had some
          heavy losses to encounter. We got over it, but I assure you, not without great pains. On
          the whole, I found Frenchmen to be as big thiefes as the rest of mankind. They bear it
          very openly too, and the English proverbe: “rather be a thief than a fool” can not be of
          other than of french origin. You have no idea with which naivete a French Bourgeois is
          capable to say: he knows he is a rogue, but that you can't hurt him. Had I known what I
          know now, I should never have taken my bones to fair France. If I was sure, I could do
          without brains, I would have tried to blow the little I have even out. As poeple told me
          lately, that it was very unhealthy to do so, I decided to leave them in, for the
          present.</p>
        <p>There are some poeple, doing very well here in Paris. These are the “Prussians“. Since the break out of this war, the german brewers, that done very badly all
          the beginning of the summer, on account of the Cholera, can not now brew enough, and the
          rooms are daily crowded.—</p>
        <p>“Kannegießen” the exclusively german speciality, the only thing
          in which they really excell, is there blooming in its smartest colours. They are so happy
          at it, that it would be pity, to see them disturbed. <pb/> I firstly was thoroughly
          disgusted with it, but when I one eavening saw, how one broad shoulderd Knödelfresser,
          turned out three proud children of Berlin, two of which were exmembers of <seg type="comment"><orig>the celebrated National-Verein</orig><note xml:id="nrg4_lhs_gz">Der
              Deutsche Nationalverein (1859–1867).</note></seg>—happy remembrance!—I got reconciled
          at this outbreak of German energy, and went often then, to amuse myself with similar
          scenes. Poor National-Verein … they can no more talk now of “Bürgerwehr und
            Volksbewaffnung”—<seg type="comment"><orig><persName key="pdrPo.001.004.000005131">The

          German history, than they had done of late. The crowned king of Prr—he said—who is the
          most monstrous representative of feudalisme in Europe and who has set out a general day of
          penitence and prayer throughout his happy lands—makes evolution now, and deals in freeing

          giving no pardon, but beeing always ready to take it and of their beeing the first nation
          on the face of earth. They came from words to blows and out went the manly
          prussians … I loose all hope—but the right of the strongest will still be the final
          solution of all questiones, from Berlin on the sand, up to Paris on the Seine!</p>
        <p>The only consolation in this whole affaire I can get is, that
          Germany has, besides of a sentimental viewing at the question, very little or nothing to
          loose in this ridiculous struggle and any future struggle or quarrel that may ensue:
          Politically—in its earliest childhood, not even capable of keeping its linen
          dry—socially—not at all existing, morally a spiteful sentimental set of dreamers,
          physically such as can be: an almost exclusively potato eating population—abstraction made
          of a few, that feed on salt herrings, on the borders of the Spree..—geographically: a mere denomination—nationally: mere
          Franzosenfressers, which they unfortunately digest to russian excrements etc. etc. such as
          they were, I say, they can not loose. Not, like in <seg type="comment"><orig>the memorable
              anti slavery war,</orig><note xml:id="nmcq_n4s_gz">Der Amerikanische Bürgerkrieg
              (1861–1865).</note></seg> where there was a sharpely defined social development
          suffocated, in its early youth, together with the reptile that tried to suck its very life
          out, not like in America, where a social existence has existed and in consequence, there
          could be a danger of loosing by waring—there can nothing of the sort be lost in our rotten
          Fatherland.</p>
        <p>The American war has done harm to the whole world, has weeled
          back history of 50 years, has cheated mankind out of its best hopes and hard work.
          Germany by waring will cheat nobody—but himself, by revolutionising with their sovereigns
          at their heads. </p>
        <p><pb/> I heard of good sources, that there was a new invention
          made in France—<hi rendition="#u">a new canon</hi>, that shall lick all that has been got
          up to now. Some 80 of them were tried, found good, and
          packed up in large strong packing cases, with the governements seal put on them, ready to
          be remooved, in time of need, from this place of confinement, on to the layers of the
          former guns. Should they be meant to accompany the psalm of 13, 14, 15?</p>

          If this shuffle had lasted another few weeks, it is not unlikely, that English working
          classes might have been able to get part of what they worked so long and tenously for. As
          it were—I fear they will meet with little sucsess. However English perseverance is
          mightier than French outbursts of anger—and what remains unfinished now, may be completed
          in a six month, when they will begin to fight on the Continent again. I do not belive in
          peace. Prussian politic has created a deep hatered among the individuals even.</p>
        <p>The French press is doing a great deal now in political economy.
          Almost every paper brings dayly arguments to proove the working classes, that they can all
          do very well if they only live economically: that means to say: work much and consume
          little. <seg type="comment"><orig>The <bibl sameAs="ed_tfp_ghf_lbb">Moniteur</bibl> as well has those last weeks brought a serie of articles called:

          sense. In England such thrash would become impossible. Every school boy would be able to
          contradict them. Even the illustrated papers bring outlines of this kind and <seg type="comment"><orig>I have cut a few lines out yesterday, which I inclose.</orig><note xml:id="d834185a-458a-48fe-9e1a-58b989c735d4">Siehe die <ref target="mega_bzq_zdv_vy">Wiedergabe der Beilage</ref>.</note></seg> The middle class must be aware of the

          Blondel, that poeple stopped in the street. He offerd to hid a young man of 20 years
          of age for his opinion, and to kick him out at the doors. He has done nothing of the sort
          in reality you may imagine. It was only an outburst of long retained Bierhaus-Politik and
          the poor young chap had to stand to it. I have no doubt but what his health must have
          improoved after such a spree. I have not seen him. I think or rather was told, that he
          made an invention, which he expected to be able to sell over here. </p>
